<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>This book is the outcome of many years of
study. With the exception of a few quotations,
none of the material has ever before appeared in
any book. The writer has been indebted for years
past to many of the physicians mentioned in the
following pages for copies of pamphlets and magazines,
and for newspaper articles, bearing upon the
medical study of alcohol. Indeed, had it not been
for the kindly counsels and hearty co-operation of
physicians, she could never have accomplished all
that was laid upon her to do as a state and national
superintendent of Medical Temperance for the
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. She is also
under obligation for helps received from the secretaries
of several State Boards of Health, and from
eminent chemists and pharmacists.</p>

<p>The object of the book is to put into the hands
of the people a statement of the views regarding
the medical properties of alcohol held by those
physicians who make little, or no use of this drug.
In most cases their views are given in their own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>language, so that the book is, of necessity, largely
a compilation.</p>

<p>It is hoped that while the laity may be glad to
peruse these pages because of the very useful and
interesting information to be obtained from them,
the medical profession, also, may be pleased to find,
in brief form, the teachings of some of their most
distinguished brethren upon a question now frequently
up for discussion in society meetings.</p>

<p>The writer does not presume to set forth her
own opinions upon a question which is still a subject
of dispute among the members of a learned
profession; she simply culls from the writings of
those members of that profession who, having
made thorough examination of the claims of
alcohol, have decided that this drug, as ordinarily
used, is more harmful than beneficial, and that
medical practice would be upon a higher plane,
were it driven entirely from the pharmacopœia.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p>When the first edition of this book was published in 1900,
there were only a few leading physicians either in Europe or
America who were ready to condemn the medical use of
alcohol. Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, Sims Woodhead,
and a few others in England; Forel, Kassowitz and one or
two more on the Continent, and Nathan S. Davis, T. D.
Crothers and J. H. Kellogg, in America, were about all that
could be quoted largely as opposed to alcoholic liquors as
remedies in disease. Whisky was then looked upon as
necessary in the treatment of consumption and diphtheria.
Ten years have brought about a great change. There are
many American physicians now willing to admit that they
have very little or no use for alcoholic liquors as remedial
agents, and now, instead of recommending whisky for consumption
anti-tuberculosis literature almost everywhere warns
against the use of intoxicating drinks. The use of anti-toxin
in diphtheria has driven out whisky treatment in that
disease with markedly favorable results. Under the whisky
treatment death-rates ran up to fifty-five and sixty per
cent.; now the diphtheria death-rate is very low. Ten years
ago many good authorities still ranked alcohol as a stimulant;
now, almost all rank it as a depressant. In England,
leading physicians and surgeons have spoken so strongly
against alcohol in the last few years that the London <i>Times</i>,
England’s leading newspaper, said: “According to recent
developments of scientific opinion, it is not impossible that a
belief in the strengthening and supporting qualities of alcohol
will eventually become as obsolete as a belief in witchcraft.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as the writer can learn from replies sent to her
inquiries by teachers of medicine, and by study of text-books
on medicine, and articles in good medical journals,
alcohol now has only a very limited use in medicine with the
great majority of successful physicians. Some recommend
wine in <i>diabetes mellitus</i>, saying that it acts less like a poison
and more like a food in that disease than in any other.
Some use alcoholic liquors in fevers as a food “to save the
burning of tissue,” but an article on “Therapeutics” in the
<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, for November
6, 1909, page 1564, says that sugar would probably have
equal value in such case. The same article says that hot
baths, with hot lemonade, and a quickly acting cathartic, will
abort a cold without any need of recourse to alcohol.</p>

<p>The writer wishes here to make grateful acknowledgment
of courtesies received from busy physicians who have aided
materially in her work by answering personal letters of inquiry,
also letters published in the <i>Journal of the American
Medical Association</i>, by kindness of the editor. Especially
would she thank those professors of medicine and superintendents
of large hospitals, who so courteously aided her in
preparing a paper for the International Congress on Alcoholism,
held in London, July, 1909, to which she was a delegate,
representing the United States government. A few of
the replies received at that time are given in this book.
There was not room for all.</p>

<p>She wishes also to acknowledge kindness and much help
received from pharmacists and druggists in the fight against
dangerous patent medicines and drug drinks sold at soda
fountains. The <i>Druggists’ Circular</i>, of New York, deserves
special mention in this connection.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to make many changes in this edition
because of the changing views on alcohol and the publicity
on patent medicines. Physicians will find Chapter XVI
entirely new, and of great interest.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF THE STUDY OF ALCOHOL.</h3>


<p>The only intoxicating drinks known to the
ancients were wines and beers. That these were
used for medicinal as well as beverage purposes is
evident from sacred and secular history. About
the tenth century of the Christian era, an Arabian
alchemist discovered the art of distillation, by
which the active principle of fermented liquors
could be drawn off and separated. To the spirit
thus produced the name alcohol was given. A
plausible reason cited for this name is that the
Arabian for evil spirit is <i>Al ghole</i>, and the effects
of the mysterious liquid upon men suggested
demoniacal possession.</p>

<p>Medical knowledge at this time was very limited:
there was no accurate way of determining the real
nature of the new substance, nor its action upon
the human system. It could be judged only by its
<i>seeming</i> effects. As these were pleasing, it was
supposed that a great medical discovery had been
made. The alchemists had been seeking a panacea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>for all the ills to which flesh is heir, indeed for
something which would enable men even to defy
Death, and the subtle new spirit was eagerly proclaimed
as the long-looked-for cure-all, if not the
very <i>aqua vitæ</i> itself. Physicians introduced it to
their patients, and were lavish in their praises of its
curative powers. The following is quoted from
the writings of Theoricus, a prominent German of
the sixteenth century, as an example of medical
opinion of alcohol in his day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It sloweth age, it strengtheneth youth, it helpeth digestion,
it cutteth phlegme, it cureth the hydropsia, it healeth the
strangurie, it pounces the stone, it expelleth gravel, it keepeth
the head from whirling, the teeth from chattering, and the
throat from rattling; it keepeth the weasen from stiffling, the
stomach from wambling, and the heart from swelling; it
keepeth the hands from shivering, the sinews from shrinking,
the veins from crumbling, the bones from aching, and the
marrow from soaking.”</p></div>

<p>Being a medicine, which very rapidly creates a
craving for itself, the demand for it became
enormous, and, as time advanced, people began
prescribing it for themselves, until its use both as
medicine and beverage became almost general.</p>

<p>If the medical profession is responsible for the
wide-spread belief that alcoholics are of service to
mankind both as food and medicine, it should not
be forgotten that it is to members of the same
profession the world is indebted for the correction
of these errors. All down through the centuries
there have been physicians who doubted and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>opposed its claims to merit. It remained for the
medical science of the latter half of the nineteenth
century to clearly demonstrate with nicely adjusted
chemical apparatus and appliances the wisdom of
these doubts.</p>

<p>The scientific study of the effects of alcohol upon
the human body began about sixty years ago. The
first American investigator was Dr. Nathan S. Davis,
of Chicago, who was the founder of the American
Medical Association. During the months of May,
June, July, September and October, 1848, Dr. Davis
published in the <i>Annalist</i>, a monthly medical journal
of New York City, a series of articles controverting
the universal opinion that alcoholic drinks are warming,
strengthening and nourishing. In 1850 he executed
an extensive series of experiments to determine
the effects of a diet exclusively carbonaceous (starch),
one exclusively nitrogenous (albumen), and alcohol
(brandy and wine), on the temperature of the living
body; on the quantity of carbonic acid exhaled; and
on the circulation of the blood. The results of these
investigations were embodied in a paper read before
the American Medical Association in May, 1851.
They showed that alcohol, instead of increasing
animal heat, and promoting nutrition and strength,
actually produced directly opposite effects, reducing
temperature, the amount of carbonic acid
exhaled, and the muscular strength. So opposed
were these conclusions to the generally accepted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>teachings of the day that the Association did not
refer the paper to the committee of publication.
It was published later in the <i>Northwestern Medical
and Surgical Journal</i>.</p>

<p>In 1854 Dr. Davis published one of the most
remarkable of the numerous works which have come
from his prolific pen; it was entitled, “A Lecture
on the Effects of Alcoholic Drinks on the Human
System, and the Duty of Medical Men in Relation
Thereto.” This lecture was delivered in Rush Medical
College, Chicago, on Christmas, 1854. An
appendix to the work contained a full account of
the series of original experiments which the author
had been conducting in relation to the effect of
alcohol upon respiration and animal heat, and gave
the same conclusions as those presented before
the A. M. A. several years previously. These
experiments laid the foundation for the scientific
study of the physiological effects of alcohol; and
their bearing upon the study of the temperance
question can even yet scarcely be appreciated.
They were the first experiments which showed
conclusively that the effect of alcohol is not that of
a stimulant, but the opposite.</p>

<p>In 1855 Prof. R. D. Mussey, of Vermont, read an
able paper before the American Medical Association
upon “The Effects of Alcohol in Health
and Disease," in which he said, “So long as
alcohol retains its place among sick patients, so
long will there be drunkards.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>In England as early as 1802, Dr. Beddoes pointed
out the dangers attendant upon the social and
medical use of intoxicating drinks, laying stress
upon “The enfeebling power of small portions of
wine regularly drunk.” In 1829 Dr. John Cheyne,
Physician General to the forces in Ireland said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The benefits which have been supposed from their liberal
use in medicine, and especially in those diseases which are
vulgarly supposed to depend upon mere weakness, have
invested these agents with attributes to which they have no
claim, and hence, as we physicians no longer employ them as
we were wont to do, we ought not to rest satisfied with the
mere acknowledgment of error, but we ought also to make
every retribution in our power for having so long upheld one of
the most fatal delusions that ever took possession of the human
mind.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Higginbotham, F. R. S., of Nottingham, a
keen and able clinical practitioner, abandoned the
prescription of alcohol in 1832, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I have amply tried both ways. I gave alcohol in my practice
for twenty years, and have now practiced without it for the
last thirty years or more. My experience is, that acute disease
is more readily cured without it, and chronic diseases much
more manageable. I have not found a single patient injured
by the disuse of alcohol, or a constitution requiring it; indeed,
to find either, although I am in my seventy-seventh year, I would
walk fifty miles to see such an unnatural phenomenon. If I
ordered or allowed alcohol in any form, either as food or as
medicine, to a patient, I should certainly do it with a felonious
intent.”&mdash;<i>Ipswich Tracts. No. 346.</i></p></div>

<p>In 1839 Dr. Julius Jeffreys drew up a medical
declaration which was signed by seventy-eight
leaders of medicine and surgery. This document
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>declared the opinion to be erroneous that wine,
beer or spirit was beneficial to health; that even in
the most moderate doses, alcoholic drinks did no
good. This, of course, dealt only with the beverage
use of alcoholics. In 1847 a second declaration
was originated, signed by over two thousand of the
most eminent physicians and surgeons. This also
referred only to liquor as a beverage. In 1871 a
third declaration, signed by two hundred and sixty-nine
of the leading members of the medical profession
was published in the London <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>This declaration was in part as follows:--</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“As it is believed that the inconsiderate prescription of large
quantities of alcoholic liquids by medical men for their patients
has given rise, in many instances, to the formation of intemperate
habits, the undersigned, while unable to abandon the use
of alcohol in the treatment of certain cases of disease, are yet
of opinion that no medical practitioner should prescribe it without
a sense of grave responsibility.</p>

<p>“They are also of opinion that many people immensely
exaggerate the value of alcohol as an article of diet, and they
hold that every medical practitioner is bound to exert his
utmost influence to inculcate habits of great moderation in the
use of alcoholic liquids.”</p></div>

<p>In the same year the American Medical Association
passed a resolution that “alcohol should be
classed with other powerful drugs, and when prescribed
medically, it should be done with conscientious
caution, and a sense of great responsibility.”</p>

<p>The physicians of New York, Brooklyn and
vicinity not long afterward published a declaration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>practically the same as that of the A. M. A., adding:
“We are of opinion that the use of alcoholic
liquor as a beverage is productive of a large
amount of physical disease.”</p>

<p>The publication of these later declarations was
the beginning of a marked change in the medical
use of alcohol.</p>

<p>In England the scientific temperance movement
began with Dr. B. W. Richardson, afterwards
knighted by Queen Victoria for his great services
to humanity as a medical philanthropist. Dr.
Richardson’s success in bringing before physicians
the remarkable medicinal agent known as nitrite of
amyl, led to a request from the British Association
for the Advancement of Science that he investigate
other chemical substances. The result was that
several years of study, beginning with 1863, were
given to the physiological effects of various alcohols,
ethylic alcohol, which is the active principle in
wines, beers and other intoxicating drinks, receiving
special attention.</p>

<p>The following is taken from his “Results of
Researches on Alcohol”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In my hands ethylic alcohol and other bodies of the same
group; viz. methylic, propylic, butylic, and amylic alcohols
were tested purely from the physiological point of view. They
were tested exclusively as chemical substances apart from any
question as to their general use and employment, and free
from all bias for or against their influence on mankind for
good or for evil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>“The method of research that was pursued was the same
that had been followed in respect to nitrite of amyl, chloroform,
ether, and other chemical substances, and it was in the following
order: First, the mode in which living bodies would take
up or absorb the substance was considered. This settled, the
quantity necessary to produce a decided physiological change
was ascertained, and was estimated in relation to the weight of
the living body on which the observation was made. After
these facts were ascertained the special action of the agent was
investigated on the blood, on the motion of the heart, on the
respiration, on the minute circulation of the blood, on the
digestive organs, on the secreting and excreting organs, on the
nervous system and brain, on the animal temperature and on
the muscular activity. By these processes of inquiry, each
specially carried out, I was enabled to test fairly the action of
the different chemical agents that came before me. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The results of these researches were that I learned purely
by experimental observation that, in its action on the living
body, alcohol deranges the constitution of the blood; unduly
excites the heart and respiration; paralyzes the minute blood-vessels;
disturbs the regularity of nervous action; lowers the
animal temperature, and lessens the muscular power.</p>

<p>“Such, independent of any prejudice of party or influence
of sentiment, are the unanswerable teachings of the sternest of
all evidences, the evidences of experiment, of natural fact
revealed to man by testing of natural phenomena.”</p></div>

<p>When Dr. Richardson reported to the Association
for the Advancement of Science the results of his
researches so at variance with commonly accepted
ideas, the Association was as incredulous as the
American Medical Association had been in 1851
when Dr. Davis gave a similar report, and Dr. Richardson’s
paper was returned to him for correction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be stated here that Dr. Richardson
was not a total abstainer when he began his study
of the effects of alcohol, but became an ardent
and enthusiastic advocate of total abstinence, and
later of non-alcoholic medication, because of what he
learned by his experiments with this drug. He
was the first to suggest that scientific temperance
be taught in the public schools, and he prepared the
first text-book ever published for this purpose. In
1874 he delivered his famous “Cantor Lectures on
Alcohol,” by request of the Society of Arts. This
series of lectures created a sensation, being attended
by crowds of people, as it was the first time that any
physician of eminence had spoken from experimental
evidence in favor of total abstinence.</p>

<p>The agitation begotten in medical circles by the
discussion of Dr. Richardson’s researches upon
alcohol led to extensive experimenting upon the
same line by scientists of England, Continental
Europe and America. The efforts of the National
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union of the
United States, led by that intrepid woman, Mrs.
Mary H. Hunt, to introduce scientific temperance
instruction into public schools gave impetus to the
study in this country. The call for text-books
caused publishers to request professors in medical
colleges to make minute research into the nature
and effects of alcohol, that the demands of the new
educational law might be met. The bitter opposition
to these temperance education laws was a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>stimulant to the scientific study of alcohol, for it was
hoped by many that the teachings regarding the
deleterious effects of alcohol might be proved incorrect.
Unfortunately for the lovers of the bibulous,
the proof was all the other way; great medical men
could not be <i>bought</i> by distillers or brewers to tell
anything but the truth, and the truth of experimental
research was all against alcohol. The text-books endorsed
by Mrs. Hunt and her advisory committee
being assailed again and again as containing erroneous
teaching, were finally, in 1897, submitted to an
examining committee of medical experts, nearly all of
whom were connected with medical colleges. This
committee consisted of Dr. N. S. Davis, Sr., of Chicago,
Ill.; Dr. Leartus Connor, of Detroit, Michigan;
Dr. Henry Q. Marcy, of Boston, Mass.; Dr. E. E.
Montgomery, of Philadelphia, Pa.; Dr. Henry D.
Holton, of Brattleboro, Vt.; and Dr. George F.
Shrady, of New York City. From their reports
upon the books the following is culled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I find no errors in the teaching of any of them on this
subject.”</p>

<p>“No statement was found at variance with the most reliable
studies of especially competent investigators.”</p>

<p>“I was asked to point out any errors in these books which
need correcting. I find no such errors.”</p>

<p>“I find their teaching completely in accordance with the
facts determined through scientific experimentation and investigation.”</p>

<p>“I find them to be in substantial accord with the results of
the latest scientific investigations.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Baer, of Berlin, Germany, the foremost European
specialist on the subject treated in these text-books,
has recently subjected the books to rigid
examination. He says in his report upon them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“On the basis of the examination I have made I can assert
that the above mentioned school text-books, (the endorsed
physiologies), in respect to their statements regarding alcoholic
drinks contain no teachings which are not in harmony with the
attitude of strict science.”</p></div>

<p>Still the opposers of the text-books were not satisfied,
and a self constituted Committee of Fifty undertook
an investigation. Men of unquestioned ability
were chosen to make researches, but the result of their
investigations was so different from what was looked
for, that, with the exception of Professor Atwater’s
contention for the food value of alcohol, the report
of the Committee of Fifty did not stir up much controversy.</p>

<p>The school text-books deal exclusively with the
effects of alcohol used as a beverage; for obvious
reasons this is all they can do. But as intoxicating
drinks have been generally supposed to contain
great virtue as remedial agents, this phase of their
nature and effects has not been overlooked by those
pursuing inquiries concerning them. While full
agreement has not yet been reached by experts as
to the value of alcoholic liquids as medicines, it is
noteworthy that some of the most eminent investigators
were led to drop alcohol from their pharma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ceutical
outfit, and the remainder to admit that its
sphere of usefulness is extremely limited.</p>

<p>There are now medical colleges of high standing
where students are advised against the use of alcohol
as a remedy; hospitals are gradually using it
less and less, some entirely discarding it; and many
progressive physicians, while saying nothing as to
their position upon the alcohol question, yet show
their lack of faith in this drug by ignoring it unless
patients or their friends desire it.</p>

<h3>THE <a name="Page_21t" id="Page_21t"></a><a href="#Page_21tn">WOMAN’S</a> CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION IN
OPPOSITION TO ALCOHOL AS MEDICINE.</h3>


<p>When the W. C. T. U. was first organized there
was no thought among its members of antagonizing
the use of alcohol in medicine. One almost immediate
result of the organization, however, was
that the women began to study the causes of inebriety,
and prominent among the prevailing influences
leading to drunkenness they found the medical
use of alcoholics. The early efforts of these women
were chiefly in rescue work through Gospel temperance
meetings, and visitations of jails and poor-houses.
By reason of this contact with the effects
of inebriety they learned many sad tales of ruined
lives, blighted homes and lost souls, through the
appetite for strong drink created, or aroused, by
alcoholic prescription. They saw, as time passed,
that some of the drunkards reclaimed through their
influence lapsed again into their evil habits because
a little beer, or wine, “for the stomach’s sake,” or
some other sake, had been advised them. Some of
the workers had this trouble in their own homes,
husband, son or other relative enslaved to alcohol
through prescription in disease. Is it any wonder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>that women of the spirit of the Crusaders, having
once had their attention thoroughly aroused to the
danger of alcohol in medicine, should begin to examine
this stronghold of the enemy to discover, if
possible, whether or not, his fortress, the medicine-chest,
was impregnable? Greatly to their joy they
found that the medical profession was not a unit in
commending alcoholics as remedial agencies, that
all along since alcohol came into common use there
have been physicians who distrusted, and opposed
it. They learned, too, that some of the most distinguished
physicians of America and of England
were using little or no alcohol in their practice, and
that a hospital had been established in London,
England, which was clearly demonstrating the superiority
of non-alcoholic medication by its small
death-rate in comparison with hospitals using alcohol.</p>

<p>This knowledge encouraged those possessing it so
that they began to refuse alcoholics as remedies in
their own households, and rarely did they find
physicians unwilling or unable to supply another
agent when asked to do so, and thousands of women
can now testify to the fact of having recovered from
ill health without the wine, beer or brandy they
were advised to take. So the W. C. T. U. discovered
several good reasons for opposing alcohol in medicine.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Its liability to create or revive an uncontrollable appetite.</p>

<p>2. A considerable number of the leading physicians of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>America and of Great Britain discard it from their list of
remedies, considering it harmful rather than helpful.</p>

<p>3. The lessened mortality consequent upon its entire disuse
demonstrated by the London Temperance Hospital.</p>

<p>4. By their own experience they knew that alcohol is not
necessary to the restoration of health, nor to the upbuilding of
strength.</p></div>

<p>The first active work touching the medical use of
alcohol was a memorial from the National W. C. T. U.
to the International Medical Congress of 1876,
which met in Washington, D. C. This memorial
was suggested by Miss Frances E. Willard, and co-operated
in by the National Temperance Society.
It asked for a deliverance from the Congress upon
alcohol as a food and as a medicine.</p>

<p>The Congress was divided into sections for the
more thorough discussion of the various topics.
Upon the program was a paper on “The Therapeutic
Value of Alcohol as Food, and as a Medicine,”
by Ezra M. Hunt, M. D., delegate from the New
Jersey Medical Society. This paper was read before
the “Section on Medicine,” and, after earnest discussion,
the conclusions of the author were adopted
“quite unanimously” as the sentiments of the Section
on Medicine. As such they were reported for
acceptance to the General Congress, and by it
ordered to be transmitted as a reply to the memorialists.</p>

<p>The report was published in full by the National
Temperance Society, and may be obtained from it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>in paper binding for twenty-five cents. As it makes
a book of 137 pages the conclusions only will be
quoted here. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. “Alcohol is not shown to have a definite food value by any
of the usual methods of chemical analysis or physiological investigation.</p>

<p>2. “Its use as a medicine is chiefly that of a cardiac stimulant,
and often admits of substitution.</p>

<p>3. “As a medicine it is not well fitted for self-prescription by
the laity, and the medical profession is not accountable for such
administration, or for the enormous evil arising therefrom.</p>

<p>4. “The purity of alcoholic liquors is in general not as well
assured as that of articles used for medicine should be. The
various mixtures when used as medicine should have definite
and known composition, and should not be interchanged promiscuously.”</p></div>

<p>It is matter for sincere regret that this deliverance
was not, in some way, brought prominently before
every physician in the land. There are, doubtless,
thousands of physicians who never heard of it, and,
consequently have never been influenced by it to
doubt the utility of the popular brandy bottle.</p>

<p>In 1883 Mrs. Mary Towne Burt, President of
New York State W. C. T. U., in her annual address,
suggested that a department of work be created to
endeavor to induce physicians to not prescribe
alcohol, unless in such cases as allowed of the use of
no other agent. Mrs. (Rev.) J. Butler, of Fairport,
was the first superintendent of this department,
which was named, “Influencing Physicians to not
Prescribe Alcoholics as Medicines.” The National W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
C. T. U. adopted the department in 1883, but soon
dropped it. In 1895 it was reinstated and Mrs. Martha
M. Allen, New York’s superintendent, was made
national superintendent. In 1905 the name of the
department was changed from Non-Alcoholic Medication,
which it had borne for fifteen years, to Medical
Temperance.</p>

<p>The objects of this department of work are:</p>

<p>1. To inform the public of the objections to the
medical use of alcoholic drinks now held by many successful
physicians.</p>

<p>2. To show the dangers in the home-prescription of
alcohol and other powerful drugs.</p>

<p>3. To expose fraudulent and dangerous proprietary
and “patent” medicines and liquid “foods,” the main
ingredients of which are alcohol and morphine.</p>

<p>4. To use persuasion with publishers of newspapers
and magazines against fraudulent medical advertising.
Also to seek legislation which shall hinder such
advertising.</p>

<p>5. To endeavor to win the attention of physicians
who prescribe alcoholic liquors to the teachings of
great leaders in their profession who have abandoned
such practice.</p>

<p>6. To bring to the attention of nurses the same
teachings, and to seek their co-operation in education
against the self-prescription of alcohol.</p>

<p>7. To work for legislation which shall correct the
evils of the whisky drug-store, the whisky-prescribing
doctor, and the dangerous “patent” medicine.</p>

<p>8. To gather the opinions upon alcohol of well-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>known
physicians who do not use it, and publish them.</p>

<p>This department originated the public agitation
against injurious and fraudulent “patent” medicines
which later was so ably carried on by <i>Collier’s Weekly</i>,
and the <i>Ladies’ Home Journal</i>. That its early work
in this direction was not better known to the general
public was due to the fact that religious as well as
secular papers were reaping large revenues from the
advertising of these nostrums, and consequently refused
to publish anything which might injure the
trade. Indeed, in accepting some of this advertising,
newspaper managers had to sign a contract that they
would not publish any reading matter opposed to the
nostrum business.</p>

<p>The <i>Christian Advocate</i> of New York city deserves
special mention for having published in 1898 two articles
written by Mrs. Allen under the caption, “The
Danger and Harmfulness of Patent Medicines.”
These were in the fall of that year published in
pamphlet form, and a copy sent to every local W. C.
T. U. in the United States for study. Tens of thousands
of copies of this and other leaflets on that theme
were distributed within a few years, some local unions
placing them in every home in their community. Medical
journals took note of this work and commended it
highly. When Mr. Bok began his campaign of education
in the <i>Ladies’ Home Journal</i>, for which he deserves
lasting gratitude, the <i>American Druggist</i> said he
was “bowing to the clamor of the W. C. T. U.”</p>

<p>This department which began in weakness, and was
for years regarded as fanatical even by many mem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>bers
of the W. C. T. U. has entered upon an era of
victories. The National Pure Food Law requires the
percentage of alcohol in patent medicines, and the presence
of different dangerous drugs, to be stated upon
the label. The prohibition law of Georgia forbids
physicians to prescribe alcoholic beverages, absolute
alcohol only being permitted. Kansas has amended her
law so that whisky drug-stores are eliminated. If
physicians prescribe alcohol the law forbids charge
for it. Alabama forbids the sale of liquor for everything
but the communion. The Internal Revenue Department
has examined a large number of “patent”
medicines and has listed them as intoxicating beverages.
Two state medical societies and some county
societies in 1908 passed resolutions to discourage the
medical use of alcoholic liquors. Two national societies
of druggists and pharmacists in 1908 passed resolutions
against whiskey drug-stores.</p>

<p>These are some of the results of Medical Temperance
agitation. Much more may be expected in the
next decade if the work is as faithfully and fearlessly
carried on as in the past.</p>

<p>This book contains much of the teachings of the department
of Medical Temperance. When these views
are generally accepted the liquor-problem will be well-nigh
solved.</p>

<h3>ALCOHOL AS A PRODUCER OF DISEASE.</h3>


<p>That alcohol is a poison is attested by all
chemists and other scientific men; taken undiluted
it destroys the vitality of the tissues of the body
with which it comes in contact as readily as creosote,
or pure carbolic acid. The term <i>intoxicating</i>
applied to beverages containing it refers to its
poisonous nature, the word being derived from the
Greek <i>toxicon</i>, which signifies a <i>bow</i> or an <i>arrow</i>;
the barbarians poisoned their arrows, hence, <i>toxicum</i>
in Latin was used to signify poison; from this
comes the English term <i>toxicology</i>, which is the
science treating of <i>poisons</i>. Druggists in selling
proof spirits usually label the bottle, “Poison.”
Apart from the testimony of science in regard to
its poisonous nature, it is commonly known that
large doses of brandy or whisky will speedily cause
death, particularly in those unaccustomed to their
use. The newspapers frequently contain items
regarding the death of children who have had
access to whisky, and drunk freely of it. Cases
are reported, too, of men, habituated to drink,
who after tossing off several glasses of brandy at
the bar of a saloon have suddenly dropped dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Mussey says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A poison is that substance, in whatever form it may be,
which, when applied to a living surface, disconcerts and disturbs
life’s healthy movements. It is altogether distinct from
substances which are in their nature nutritious. It is not
capable of being converted into food, and becoming a part of
the living organs. We all know that proper food is wrought
into our bodies; the action of animal life occasions a constant
waste, and new matter has to be taken in, which, after digestion,
is carried into the blood, and then changed; but poison is
incapable of this. It may indeed be mixed with nutritious substances,
but if it goes into the blood, it is thrown off as soon as
the system can accomplish its deliverance, if it has not been
too far enfeebled by the influence of the poison. Such a poison
is alcohol&mdash;such in all its forms mix it with what you may.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Nathan S. Davis said in an address given in
1891:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When largely diluted with water, as it is in all the varieties
of fermented and distilled liquids, and taken into the stomach,
it is rapidly imbibed, or taken up by the capillary vessels and
carried into the venous blood, without having undergone any
digestion or change in the stomach. With the blood it is
carried to every part, and made to penetrate every tissue of the
living body, where it has been detected by proper chemical
tests as unchanged alcohol, until it has been removed through
the natural process of elimination, or lost its identity by
molecular combination with the albuminous elements of the
blood and tissues, for which it has a strong affinity.</p>

<p>“The most varied and painstaking experiments of chemists
and physiologists, both in this country and Europe, have shown
conclusively that the presence of alcohol in the blood diminishes
the amount of oxygen taken up through the air-cells of
the lungs; retards the molecular and metabolic changes of both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>nutrition and waste throughout the system and diminishes the
sensibility and action of the nervous structures in direct proportion
to the quantity of alcohol present. By its stronger affinity
for water and albumen, with which it readily unites in all proportions,
it so alters the hemaglobin of the blood as to lessen
its power to take the oxygen from the air-cells of the lungs and
carry it as oxyhemaglobia to all the tissues of the body; and by
the same affinity it retards all atomic or molecular changes in
the muscular, secretory and nervous structures; and in the
same ratio it diminishes the elimination of carbon-dioxide, phosphates,
heat and nerve force. In other words, its presence
diminishes all the physical phenomena of life.</p>

<p>“I say, then, that from the facts hitherto adduced, whether
from accurate experimental investigations in different countries,
from the pathological results developed in the most scientific
societies, from the most reliable statistics of sickness and mortality,
as influenced by occupations and social habits, or from
the life insurance records kept on a uniform basis through
periods of ten, twenty, thirty or even forty years, it is clearly
shown that alcohol when taken into the human system not
only acts upon the nervous system, perverting its sensibility,
and, if increased in quantity, causing intoxication or insensibility,
but it also, <i>even in small quantities</i>, lessens the oxygenation
and decarbonization of the blood and retards the molecular
changes in the structures of the body. When these effects are
continued through months and years, as in the most temperate
class of drinkers, <i>they lead to permanent structural changes,
most prominently in the liver, kidneys, stomach, heart, blood-vessels
and nerve structures, and lessen the natural duration
of life in the aggregate from ten to fifteen years</i>. Consequently
there is no greater, nor more destructive error existing
in the public mind than the belief that the use of fermented
and distilled drinks does no harm so long as they do not intoxicate.</p>

<p>“Another popular error is the opinion that the substitution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>of the different varieties of beer and wine in the place of distilled
liquors promotes temperance, and lessens the evil effects
of alcohol on the health and morals of those who use them.
Accurate investigations show that beer and wine drinkers generally
consume more alcohol per man than the spirit drinkers;
and while they are not as often intoxicated, they suffer fully as
much from diseases and premature death as do those who use
distilled spirits. Again, the beer drinker drinks more nearly
every day, and thereby keeps some alcohol in his blood more
constantly; while a large percentage of spirit drinkers drink
only periodically, leaving considerable intervals of abstinence,
during which the tissues regain nearly their natural condition.
The more constant and persistent is the presence of alcohol
in the blood and the tissues, even in moderate quantity, the
more certainly does it lead to perverted and degenerative changes
in the tissues, <i>ending in renal </i>(kidney)<i> and hepatic </i>(liver)<i>
dropsies, cardiac </i>(heart)<i> failures, gout, apoplexy and paralysis</i>.”</p></div>

<p>Sir B. W. Richardson says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol produces many diseases; and it constantly happens
that persons die of diseases which have their origin solely
in the drinking of alcohol, while the cause itself is never for a
moment suspected. A man may say quite truthfully that he
never was tipsy in the whole course of his life; and yet it is
quite possible that such a man may die of disease caused by
the alcohol he has taken, and by no other cause whatever.
This is one of the most dreadful evils of alcohol, that it kills
insidiously, as if it were doing no harm, or as if it were doing
good, while it is destroying life. Another great evil of it is
that it assails so many different parts of the body. It hardly
seems credible at first sight that the same agent can give rise to
the many different kinds of diseases it does give rise to. In
fact, the universality of its action has blinded even learned men
as to its potency for destruction.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>“Step by step, however, we have now discovered that its
modes of action are all very simple, and are all the same in
character; and that the differences that have been and are seen
in different persons under its influence are due mainly to the
organs, or organ, which first give way under it. Thus, if the
stomach gives way first, we say that the person has indigestion
or dyspepsia, or failure of the stomach; if the brain gives way
first, we say the person has paralysis, or apoplexy, or brain disease;
if the liver gives way first, we say the man has liver disease,
and so on.</p>

<p>“All persons who indulge much in any form of alcoholic
drink are troubled with indigestion. When they wake in the
morning they find their mouth dry, their tongue coated, and
their appetite bad. In course of time they become confirmed
‘dyspeptics,’ and as many of them find a temporary relief from
the distress at the stomach, and the deficient appetite from
which they suffer by taking more liquor, they increase the quantity
taken, and so make matters much worse. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“There are a great number of diseases caused by alcohol,
some of which are known by terms that do not convey to the
mind what really has been the cause of the diseases.” They are:</p></div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Diseases of the brain and nervous system:
indicated by such names as apoplexy, epilepsy, paralysis,
vertigo, softening of the brain, delirium tremens,
loss of memory and that general failure of the
mental power called dementia. (<i>b</i>) Diseases of the
lungs: one form of consumption, congestion and
subsequent bronchitis. (<i>c</i>) Diseases of the heart:
irregular beat, feebleness of the muscular walls, dilation,
disease of the valves. (<i>d</i>) Diseases of the blood:
scurvy, dropsy, separation of fibrine. (<i>e</i>) Diseases
of the stomach: feebleness of the stomach and indi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>gestion,
flatulency, irritation and sometimes inflammation.
(<i>f</i>) Diseases of the bowels: relaxation or
purging, irritation. (<i>g</i>) Diseases of the liver: congestion,
hardening and shrinking cirrhosis. (<i>h</i>)
Diseases of the kidneys: change of structure into
fatty or waxy-like condition and other changes leading
to dropsy. (<i>i</i>) Diseases of the muscles: fatty
changes in the muscles, by which they lose their
power for proper active contraction. (<i>j</i>) Diseases
of the membranes of the body: thickening and loss
of elasticity, by which the parts wrapped up in the
membrane are impaired for use, and premature
decay is induced.</p>

<p>But it constantly happens that when deaths from
these diseases are recorded and alcohol has been
the primary cause, some other cause is believed to
have been at work.</p>

<p>While drinking parents by virtue of a strong constitution
sometimes escape the penalty of their
bibulous habit, it is not uncommon to see their
children suffering from some disease or nervous
weakness such as is caused by alcohol, “the sins of
the father being visited upon the children.”</p>

<p>Erasmus Darwin says upon this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is remarkable that all the diseases from drinking spirituous
or fermented liquors are liable to become hereditary, even
to the third generation, gradually increasing, if the cause be
continued, till the family become extinct.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. Christison, of Edinburgh, in answer to in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>quiries
from the Massachusetts State Board of
Health, says of general diseases due to alcohol:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I recognize certain diseases which originate in the vice of
drunkenness alone, which are <i>delirium tremens</i>, cirrhosis of the
liver, many cases of Bright’s disease of the kidneys, and dipsomania,
or insane drunkenness.</p>

<p>“Then I recognize many other diseases in regard to which
excess in alcoholics acts as a powerful predisposing cause, such
as gout, gravel, aneurism, paralysis, apoplexy, epilepsy, cystitis,
premature incontinence of urine, erysipelas, spreading cellular
inflammation, tendency of wounds and sores to gangrene, inability
of the constitution to resist the attacks of epidemics. I
have had a fearful amount of experience of continued fever in
our infirmary during many epidemics, and in all my experience
I have only once known an intemperate man of forty and upwards
to recover.”</p></div>

<p>Professor Christison also claims that three-fourths,
or even four-fifths, of Bright’s disease in Scotland is
produced by alcohol.</p>

<p>Dr. C. Murchison, in speaking of alcohol as a preventive
of disease, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is no greater error than to imagine that a liberal
allowance of alcoholic liquids fortifies the system against contagious
diseases.”</p></div>

<p>In a paper read before the Royal Medical and
Chirurgical Society, Oct. 22, 1872, Dr. W. Dickinson
gave the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol causes fatty infiltration and fibrous encroachments;
it engenders tubercles; encourages suppuration, and retards
healing; it produces untimely atheroma (a form of fatty degeneration
of the inner coats of the arteries), invites hemorrhage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>and anticipates old age. The most constant fatty changes, replacement
by oil of the material of epithelial cells and muscular
fibres, though probably nearly universal, is most noticeable in
the liver, the heart and the kidneys. <i>Drink causes tuberculosis</i>,
which is evident not only in the lungs, but in every amenable organ.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. William Hargreaves says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Brandy is not a prophylactic. To the temperate it is an
active, exciting cause. It is well known that a single act of
intemperance during the prevalence of cholera, will often produce
a fatal attack. The sense of warmth and irritation
(called stimulation) produced by alcoholic liquors, has led to
the erroneous notion that they may prevent cholera. But the
contrary we have seen is the truth, for the effects of alcoholics
are to reduce the temperature of the body, and instead of
stimulating, they narcotize, and reduce the life-forces, and
predispose the system to all kinds of disease.”</p></div>

<p>The following testimonies are culled from the
writings of eminent physicians:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir Andrew Clark, M. D., F. R. C. P., London, Physician in
Ordinary to the Queen, Senior Physician at the London
Hospital: “As I looked at the hospital wards to-day, and
saw that seven out of ten owed their diseases to alcohol, I
could but lament that the teaching about this question is not
more direct, more decisive and more home-thrusting. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Can I say to you any words stronger than these of the terrible
effects of alcohol? When I think of this I am disposed to
give up my profession, and go forth upon a holy crusade,
preaching to all men&mdash;<i>Beware of this enemy of the race.</i>”</p>

<p>Sir William Gull, F. R. S. (late Physician to her Majesty):
“I should say, from my experience, that alcohol is the most
destructive agent that we are aware of in this country. I
would like to say that a very large number of people in society
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>are dying day by day, poisoned by alcohol, but not supposed to
be poisoned by it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Abernethy: “If people will leave off drinking alcohol,
live plainly, and take very little medicine they will find that
many disorders will be relieved by this treatment alone.”</p>

<p>Dr. Forel, of the University of Zurich, Switzerland: “Life
is considerably shortened by the use of alcohol in large quantities.
But a moderate consumption of the same also shortens
life by an average of five to six years. This is consistently and
unequivocally seen in the statistics kept for thirty years by
English insurance companies, with special sections for abstainers.
They give a large discount, and still make more
profit, as not nearly so many deaths occur as might be expected
under the usual calculations. According to federal statistics in
the fifteen largest towns of Switzerland, over ten per cent. of
the men over twenty years of age die solely, or partly of alcoholism.”</p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg, Battle Creek, Mich.: “Every organ feels
the effect of the abuse through indulgence in alcohol, and no
function is left undisturbed. By degrees, disordered function,
through long continuance of the disturbance, induces tissue
change. The most common form of organic or structural
disease due to alcohol is fatty degeneration, which may effect
almost every organ in the body. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* No class of persons
are so subject to nervous diseases due to degeneration of
nerves and nerve-centres as drinkers. Partial or general
paralysis, locomotor ataxia, epilepsy and a host of other nervous
disorders, are directly traceable to the use of alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>One of the visiting physicians of Bellevue Hospital,
New York, states that at least two-thirds of
all the diseases treated there originated in drink.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dr. W. A. Hammond: “It is of all causes most prolific in
exciting derangements of the brain, the spinal cord, and the
nerves.”</p></div>

<h3>TEMPERANCE HOSPITALS.</h3>


<h4>THE LONDON TEMPERANCE HOSPITAL.</h4>

<p>In 1865 Dr. S. Nicholls, medical officer of the
Longford Poor-law Union, published a report of
the results of non-alcoholic treatment of disease as
practiced by him for sixteen years in the institutions
under his control. The figures for 1865 were:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><i>The treatment was altogether without wines,
spirits or alcohol in any form.</i></p>

<p>The death-rate reported by Dr. Nicholls was so
small that some of the more observing and progressive
physicians were led by it to begin similar
experiments in the disuse of alcohol in other hospitals.
Among these was Dr. James Edmunds, senior
physician at the Lying-In Hospital, London. The
experiments continued a year with a reduced death-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>rate
among both mothers and children. But the
great brewers of London, who contributed largely
to the support of this hospital raised such a storm
of opposition to the discontinuance of alcoholic
liquors that the experiments had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The establishment of a temperance hospital was
now suggested, and in October, 1873, a temporary
institution was opened in Gower Street, accommodating
only seventeen in-patients at one time. Later
a fine site was secured on Hampstead Road, and in
1881 the east wing and centre were opened by the
Lord Mayor of London. In 1885 the west wing
was finished, and the opening ceremonies conducted
by the Bishop of London.</p>

<p>At the time of the launching of this enterprise,
wine and spirits were literally “poured into” sick
persons, with frightful results. Death-rates were
enormous. The success of the Temperance Hospital
has no doubt had much to do in modifying this
abuse. Its death-rate, on an average, has been only
6 per cent. throughout the years since its beginning.
This is lower than that of any other general hospital
in London, and certainly proves conclusively
that alcohol is not necessary in the treatment of
disease. The physicians connected with it have
been men of eminence in the profession, such as
Dr. James Edmunds, Dr. J. J. Ridge and Sir B.
W. Richardson.</p>

<p>The visiting staff is not compelled to pledge disuse
of alcohol, but is required to report if it is used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
During all these years it has been given only seventeen
times, then almost entirely in surgical cases,
and in nearly all of these a fatal result proved it to
be useless. The patients who are restored to
health leave without having had aroused or implanted
in them a desire for alcoholic liquors,
neither have they been taught to regard them as
valuable aids to the recovery of health and strength.
On the contrary, there have been many who have
come in, suffering from this delusion, who have had
it thoroughly dispelled, both by their own experience
and the experience of their fellow patients.</p>

<p>Sir B. W. Richardson took charge of this hospital
from 1892 until his death in 1897. In his report in
1893 he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I remember quite well when according to custom, I should
have prescribed alcohol in all those cases that were not actually
inflammatory (speaking of diseases of the alimentary system);
but I never remember having seen such quick and sound
recoveries as those which have followed the non-alcoholic
method.”</p></div>

<p>The following selection showing points of practice
in this hospital is taken from the same report:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“For medicinal purposes, we are as free as possible from all
complexity. We use glycerine for making what may be called
our tinctures, and in my clinique I am introducing a series of
‘waters’&mdash;aqua ferri, aqua chloroformi, aqua opii, aqua quinæ,
and so on&mdash;to form the menstruums of other active drugs when
they are called for. I also follow the plan of having the medicines
administered with a free quantity of water, and with as
accurate a dosage as can be obtained, for I agree with Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Spender’s original proposition that the administration of medicines
in comparatively small and frequent doses is more
effective and useful than the more common plan of large doses
given at long intervals.</p>

<p>“I treat many cases by inhalation, and for this end I use
oxygen in a new and, I hope, efficient manner. I make oxygen
gas a medium for carrying other volatile substances that admit
of being inhaled with it. The mode is very simple. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
In the pneumonic and bronchial cases the treatment has been
of the simple and sustaining kind. The medicines that have
been given during the acute febrile stages have been chiefly
liquor ammoniæ acetatis and carbonate of ammonia in small
and frequently repeated doses. The patients have all been
well and carefully fed on the milk and middle diet until convalescence
was declared. In some of the more extreme instances,
where there was fear of collapse from separation of
fibrine in the heart or pulmonary artery, ammonia has been
given freely according to the method I have for so many years
inculcated. I have also in cases of depression under which
fibrinous separation is so easily developed, lighted on a mode
of administering ammonia which combines feeding with the
medicine. I direct that a three or five-grain tabloid of bicarbonate
of ammonia shall be dissolved in a cup of coffee or
of coffee with milk, and be taken by the patient in that manner.
The coffee can be sweetened with sugar if that is desired
by the patient, and the ammonia can be so administered without
any objectionable taste to the beverage. After what is
called the crisis in acute pneumonia, I administer very little
medicine of any kind; I trust rather to careful feeding with
an occasional alterative or expectorant, as may be required.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I am satisfied that no aid I could have derived from
alcoholic stimulants, as they are called, could have bettered my
results. I feel sure any candid medical brother who will have
the steady courage to put aside many old and unproven, though
much-practiced, methods, based only on unquestioning and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>unquestioned experience, and to move into these new fields of
observation and experience, will, in the end, find no fault with
me for leaving a track which, though it be beaten very firmly
and be very wide and smooth to traverse, may not, after all, be
the surest and soundest path to the golden gate of cure.”</p></div>


<h4>THE FRANCES E. WILLARD NATIONAL TEMPERANCE
HOSPITAL.</h4>

<p>This hospital is situated at 343-349 South Lincoln
Street, Chicago, in a handsome and well-equipped
building. It is connected with a medical school. The
history of its origin is best told in the words of the
woman to whom the conception of such an institution
first came, Dr. Mary Weeks Burnett, for several years
the physician in charge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In the fall of 1883 there came to a few of us the thought
that there was a point of weakness in the temperance pledge.
It reads, ‘We promise to abstain from all liquors&mdash;<i>as a beverage</i>.’
We had found in many instances in reform work that
pledging to abstain from liquor ‘as a beverage,’ and leaving
the victim to the unlimited use of it in physicians’ prescriptions,
was simply a skirmish with the devil’s outposts, that the conflict,
based upon these grounds, was short, and defeat almost
sure; and the great fact remained that the innermost recesses
of evil force and power were by this pledge still left unassailed.
We found that this power of evil had largely entered the homes
of our land through the family physicians, and that willingly or
not, the physicians were being used to bring in even our innocent
children as recruits to this unrighteous warfare.</p>

<p>“Now, how could we hope to eliminate those three little
words ‘as a beverage’ from our pledge?</p>

<p>“In some way we must bring about an arrest of thought in
the minds of 100,000 men and women physicians whose medi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>cal
education warranted them in supposing that they knew that
of alcohol which justified them in its full and free use in medical
practice. Nothing short of a great national object lesson
could ever convict and convert this broad constituency through
which the power of darkness is doing his deadliest work.</p>

<p>“In January, 1884, four of us met and organized under the
name of the National Temperance Hospital. To have our sick
properly cared for in our hospital we found that we should be
obliged to train our own nurses. The nurse who has always
been accustomed to administering alcohol under the physician’s
prescription at all times and under all circumstances, and to administering
it herself at her own discretion if the physician is
not at hand, is a terror to the temperance physician. So we included
in our charter a Training School for Nurses. It is now
open, and we expect, as the years go by, to send out armed
with our training school diplomas, grand, noble women and
men thoroughly trained in true temperance methods for relieving
the sick.</p>

<p>“Our organization lived on paper, and was sustained in purpose
by prayer and planning for two years. In September,
1885, Mr. R. G. Peters, of Manistee, Michigan, signified to us
his intention to give $50,000 toward our buildings whenever we
had satisfactorily materialized. About the same time a good
old gentleman in Michigan placed in his will for us $2,500.
The dear man is still living, and we hope will live many years.
Even the money when it comes can never be of greater service
to us than was the knowledge at that time that the Lord was
our leader and was raising up helpers in the work.</p>

<p>“In January, 1886, we found, according to the law under
which our charter was obtained, that we must commence active
operations at once, or obtain a new charter. After a blessed
season of prayer and counseling together in the board meeting
held January 29, there being present only the members of the
board at that time, Mrs. Plumb offered to advance $3,500, if
necessary, toward the expenses for the first year. We accepted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>it with great thankfulness, rented a building the 15th of March,
1886, and formally opened the National Temperance Hospital on
the 4th of May, 1886.</p>

<p>“In April, 1886, we took a firm stand upon the alcohol question,
and decided to eliminate it entirely from our list of therapeutics,
as we had become convinced that there were better and
more reliable remedies as stimulants and tonics.</p>

<p>“In September, 1886, at our annual meeting, we reaffirmed
this decision, and we now have the following as one of the articles
of our constitution: ‘All medicines used in the hospital
must be prepared without alcohol, and all physicians accepting
positions on the medical staff of the hospital or dispensary must
pledge themselves not to administer alcohol in any form to any
patient in hospital or dispensary, nor to call in counsel for such
patients any physician who will advise the use of alcohol.</p>

<p>“Any physician of pure character, and in good standing, who
is a total abstainer from liquor and tobacco can, by subscribing
to this pledge, become a member of our physicians’ association,
and if so desired, be placed upon the visiting and consulting
staff of the hospital.</p>

<p>“The cases treated in the hospital include many of the serious
medical and surgical maladies. In no case has any particle
of alcohol been used, and the usual inflammatory secondary
symptoms resulting when alcohol is used have been entirely
avoided.</p>

<p>“Our course of building-up treatment is, we believe, unique
in hospital practice. It consists of treatment by massage, heat,
rest, passive exercise, etc., together with proper medication and
a thoroughly nutritious diet adapted to the individual needs of
the patient.</p>

<p>“To alleviate, and, if possible, cure disease, is the design of
all hospital treatment. In our hospital we seek to gain this result
by means which the highest science of the day approves,
and in addition to this we have especially at heart the advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>ment
of the temperance reform. There are, we believe, thousands
of temperance adherents, who do not yet fully apprehend
the importance of this hospital to the permanent extension and
progress of temperance principles. Although prohibition as a
<i>principle</i> has been accepted by many, yet in its <i>practical application</i>
in the home in serious illness, it is still feared by the immense
majority of even our strongest prohibitionists. We are
organized upon the basis <i>no alcohol in medicine</i>, and we are
preparing to demonstrate fully and scientifically, so he who runs
may read, that as in health, so in disease and accident, alcohol
in any form works to the hindrance and injury of the vital
forces, and prevents the establishment and advancement of
health processes in the system.”</p></div>

<p>At the opening of the hospital, May 4, 1886, Miss
Frances E. Willard, the president of the National
W. C. T. U., gave the following address:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Nothing is changeless except change. The conservatives of
one epoch are the madmen of the next, even as the radicals of
to-day would have been the lunatics of yesterday. To prove
this, just imagine the founders of this hospital declaring to my
great-grandfather that because he had taken a cold was no reason
why he should take a toddy; and <i>per contra</i>, imagine my
great-grandfather’s doctor marching into our presence here and
now, with saddle-bags on arm, and after treating us each to a
glass of grog for our stomach’s sake, giving us a scientific
disquisition on the sovereign virtues of the blue pill, and informing
us that bleeding, cupping and starvation were the surest
methods of cure!</p>

<p>“That the story of Evolution is true I am by no means certain,
but that ‘We, Us, and Company,’ are ‘evoluting’ with electric
speed ourselves it is useless to deny. This very hospital
is the latest mile-stone on the highway of progress in the American
temperance reform. The conditions that have made its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>existence possible have developed in this country within about
twelve years.</p>

<p>“Public opinion, that mightiest of magicians, has within that
time been educated up to this level and has said in its omnipotence:
‘Hospital, be!’ and, behold, the hospital <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>“When I joined the ranks of temperance workers in 1874, a
thought so adventurous as that alcoholics in relation to medicine
were a curse and not a blessing had never lodged within
my cranium. But, as in duty bound, I studied the subject from
the practical, which is the nineteenth century standpoint.</p>

<p>“I investigated the cause of inebriety, and found the medical
use of alcoholic stimulants a prominent factor in this horrible
result; I sought for expert testimony, and found Dr. N. S. Davis,
ex-President American Medical Association, saying ‘that in his
ample clinical practice he had for over thirty years tested the
medical uses of alcoholics, and had <i>found no case of disease
and no emergency arising from accident that he could not
treat more successfully without any form of fermented or
distilled liquors than with</i>’; found Dr. James R. Nichols, of
Boston, so long editor of <i>The Journal of Chemistry</i>, declaring
as his deliberate scientific opinion that the entire banishment of
these liquors ‘would not deprive us of a single one of the indispensable
agents which modern civilization demands’; found Dr.
Green, of Boston, saying before the physicians of that city that
it is upon the members of the medical profession and the exceptional
laws which it has always demanded, that the whole
liquor fraternity depends more than upon anything else to
screen it from opprobrium and just punishment for the evils it
entails, and that after thirty years of professional experience he
felt assured that alcoholic stimulants are not required as medicines,
and that many, if not a majority of the best physicians,
now believe them <i>to be worse than useless</i>. Meanwhile I
learned that across the sea such great physicians as Dr. Benjamin
Ward Richardson, Sir Andrew Clark, Sir Henry Thompson
and Sir William Gull held views which for their latitude were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>almost equally radical; and Dr. James Edmunds, founder of
the London Temperance Hospital had demonstrated publicly
and on a grand scale the more excellent way, his hospital having
4½ per cent. fewer deaths than any other in London, taking the
same run of cases, and that the Royal Infirmary at Manchester
reported the medicinal use of alcohol fallen off 87 per cent. in
recent years, with a decrease in its death-rate of over one-third.
Besides all this, and independent of any such investigation, the
‘intuitions’ of our most earnest women were leading them out of
the wilderness. As is their custom, they determined to put
this matter to the test of that ‘experience which one experiences
when he experiences his own experience,’ and a whole
body of divinity upon the advantages of non-alcoholic treatment
could be furnished from their evidence. I was not able personally
to pursue this method, my own condition of good health
having become chronic. Away back in 1875, in executive
committee, one of our leading officers was stricken with <i>angina
pectoris</i>. A physician was promptly summoned. ‘Give her
brandy,’ he said, and insisted so stoutly upon it as vital to her
recovery that we should probably have sent for it, but the dear
woman gasped out faintly, ‘I can die, but I can’t touch brandy.’
She is alive and flourishing to-day. Another national officer
absolutely refused whisky for a violent attack of a very different
character, the physician telling her that she could not live
through the night without it; but she is still an active worker&mdash;a
living witness that doctors are not infallible. Instances
like these have multiplied by hundreds and thousands in our
Woman’s Christian Unions and Bands of Hope. ‘No, mamma
I can’t touch liquor; I’ve signed the pledge,’ is a protest
‘familiar as household words.’ Meanwhile, I beg you to contemplate
something else that has happened. Behold, our own
beloved beverage itself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Sparkling and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its liquid light,’<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>has come grandly to our rescue in this crusade against alcohol
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>in the sick room. Water has become a favorite&mdash;nay, even a
fashionable&mdash;medicine! The most conservative physicians
freely prescribe it in the very cases where some form of alcohol
was the specific so long. To be sure, they give it hot,
but we do not object to that, since ‘water hot ne’er made a
sot,’ and it cures dyspepsia and all forms of indigestion as
whisky never did, but only made believe to; while its external
use as a fomentation is banishing alcohol even for old
folks’ ‘rheumatiz’ where, as a remedy, it would be likely to
make its final stand.</p>

<p>“Farewell, thou cloven-foot, Alcohol! Thou canst no longer
hide away in the home-like old camphor bottle, paregoric bottle,
peppermint bottle or Jamaica-ginger bottle; and a tender
good-by, Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup, for be it known to
you that the wonderful discovery stumbled over for six thousand
years has in our day been made, namely, that hot water
will soothe the baby’s stomach-aches and the grown people’s
pains, and drive out a cold when all else fails. <i>Jubilate!</i>
Clear out the cupboard and top shelf of the closet now that the
sideboard has gone. Let great Nature have a glance to
‘mother up’ humanity with the medicine, as well as the
beverage, brewed in Heaven.”</p></div>


<h4>THE RED CROSS HOSPITAL.</h4>

<p>A philanthropic young woman, Miss Bettina A.
Hofker, entered Mount Sinai Training School for
Nurses in 1891. Her desire was to fit herself as a
nurse for the poor. After her graduation in 1893,
she met Mrs. Charles A. Raymond, a benevolent
lady, who offered her pecuniary assistance in her
work. Miss Hofker suggested that she would like
to institute a Red Cross Hospital and Training
School for Nurses. Mrs. Raymond succeeded in interesting
others in the proposition. The name of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Red Cross however could not be used without
permission of the officers of the society bearing
that name, but after consultation with Miss Barton,
permission was granted. Several years previous to
this, Dr. A. Monæ Lesser, Dr. Thomas McNicholl
and Dr. Gottlieb Steger had opened a small hospital
under the name of St. John’s Institute. This was
now amalgamated with the Red Cross, and Dr.
George F. Shrady and Dr. T. Gaillard Thomas, two
of New York’s leading physicians, were requested
to act as consulting physicians.</p>

<p>The hospital does not confine itself to service in
its building alone, but sends its workers wherever
called, to mansion or tenement. The “Sisters” are
trained for field service or for any national calamity
such as floods, earthquakes, forest fires, epidemics,
etc. When neither war nor calamities require their
presence, they devote themselves to the service of
the needy poor, or wait upon the rich, if called.
The heroic service rendered by the surgeons and
nurses from this hospital in the Cuban War,
brought their work into great prominence.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Miss Barton, the medical
department of the hospital was <a name="Page_48t" id="Page_48t"></a><a href="#Page_48tn">commissioned</a> to
treat diseases without the use of alcoholic liquids.</p>

<p>Dr. Lesser, the executive surgeon, is a German,
and of German education, having received his medical
education in the Universities of Berlin and
Leipsic. In a conversation with a press representative,
Dr. Lesser said some time ago:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We have been convinced that the use of alcohol can be
entirely eliminated from our medical practice, and this has been
practically accomplished at the Red Cross Hospital. We find
that where stimulants are required, such remedies as caffeine,
nitro-glycerine and kolafra take the place of alcohol, and are
even more satisfactory. The main use of alcohol is to stimulate
the action of the heart in various ailments. The blood is thus
forced to the remote parts of the system, and poisonous substances
carried away. But, besides serving this good purpose,
the drug tears down and ultimately destroys the cellular tissues
of the body. A relapse is certain to follow the application.
The drugs that I have mentioned serve exactly the same purpose
without the disastrous results. We are proving this every day
at the Red Cross Hospital.</p>

<p>“Only a few days ago a boy was brought in, apparently at
the point of death. He was put into bed and watched by the
nurse. After a little ammonia had been given to him as a
stimulant, he unconsciously expressed himself to the effect
that it was not the same as they gave him in another place, and
gradually when it dawned upon him that no alcohol was
administered by the Red Cross, he said, ‘Gin has allers made
me better.’ The doctor in charge, who already suspected that
the boy was pretending illness for the sake of the drink, was not
surprised an hour or two afterwards to learn that he had
demanded his clothes, dressed himself, and left the hospital
most ungratefully, but apparently quite well.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. George F. Shrady, one of the consulting physicians,
is famous as having been in attendance
upon both President Garfield and President Grant.
He is the editor of the <i>Medical Record</i>, one of the
most important medical journals published in
America. While not a non-alcoholic physician, he
says of the medical use of intoxicants:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is altogether too much looseness among physicians
in prescribing alcohol. It is a dangerous drug. There is much
more alcohol used by physicians than is necessary, and it does
great harm. Whisky is not a preventive; it prevents no disease
whatever, contrary to a current notion. Another thing,
we physicians get blamed wrongfully in many cases. People
who want to drink, and do drink, often lay it on to the physician
who prescribed it. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I think that in most cases
where alcohol is now used, other drugs with which we are
familiar could be used with far better effect, and with no harmful
results.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Steger, another physician of the staff, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I don’t use alcohol at all in my practice. I used to use it,
but my observation has been that other drugs do the same
work without the harmful results. Alcohol over-stimulates the
heart, and tears down the cellular tissues of the system, besides
causing other deleterious effects. The use of alcohol is simply
a superstition among physicians. They have used it so long
that they think they always must. I am not a total abstainer,
but that only shows that I take better care of my patients than
I do of myself. It is not good for a healthy man to drink, but
sometimes folks like myself do things which had better be left
undone. I have seen patients in hospitals made absolutely
drunk by their physicians.”</p></div>

<p>The following interesting items in regard to
practice in this hospital are culled from the report
of 1897:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Temperature was never reduced by active drugs known as
antipyretics.</p>

<p>“Water was allowed freely after all kinds of surgical operations
and in fevers.</p>

<p>“Alcohol was never used as an internal medicine.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>“The free use of water in saline solutions directly injected
into the tissues was found of great service. Quarts have been
injected that way with most satisfactory results.</p>

<p>“Antipyretics were altogether discarded as it is well known
that their action diminishes the tone of the heart. Artificial
reduction of temperature only deludes one into the belief that
the drug has improved the condition of the patient, while in
reality, it has no beneficial influence on the disease, and has
reduced the vital resistance of the patient. In no case has high
temperature harmed a patient and there was every evidence
that in some instances a high temperature was preferable to a
low one.</p>

<p>“Special attention has been given to the use of alcohol in
disease, not with any desire to approve or disapprove it, but
solely for the purpose of discovering the truth, for nothing
seems of greater public interest from a medical standpoint than
the truth regarding a subject for which so many virtues are
claimed on the one hand, and so many destructive elements
proven on the other. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“We criticise the treatment of no institution, antagonize no
school of medicine, claim no unusual or peculiar scientific
virtue, but what we do maintain and insist upon is this: that
the human body may be ever so afflicted, ever so reduced, the
heart ever so feeble, and the spark of life ever so dim, the
conscientious student of medicine can secure as good results
without as with administration of antipyretics, sparkling wines,
beers or liquors.</p>

<p>“Experience teaches that true science does not antagonize
nature. In surgical cases, in septicæmia, in pneumonia, or in
any of the fevers, water freely administered has proven to be a
real source of comfort, and an aid to recovery. It is amazing
how favorably diseases terminate under this beneficent beverage.
The withholding of food does not retard, but rather hastens
convalescence.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>“In the conduct of our Red Cross patients, irrespective of
their condition when admitted, it can be truly said that after
treatment began, delirium has not been witnessed in a single
instance, and as our hospital reports indicate, our mortality
has been unusually small.</p>

<p>“Alcohol has not figured as a life-saver in our institution.
Cases of extreme collapse following major operations, cases of
pneumonia, where the pulse ranged from 160 to 220, patients
suffering from pernicious anæmia, septicæmia, pyæmia, cholera
infantum and typhoid fever, some of whom when first seen were
in the worst stages of delirium and collapse have without
alcohol regained consciousness, overcome delirium and made
excellent recoveries.</p>

<p>“The following cases very forcibly illustrate the results of
non-alcoholic treatment:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Case No. 1. A child, aged nine months, under treatment
for six days for pneumonia, came under our notice on the
seventh day. The temperature was 106 5-10; pulse was 220;
respirations 90. Whisky, which had been given previously to
the extent of two ounces daily, was stopped. Carbonate of
ammonia, caffeine salicylate, nitro-glycerine and 1-10 of a drop
of aconite were given internally; camphorated lard applied
externally; with the result that on the ninth day temperature
stood 99; pulse 100; respiration 20. The child made a complete
recovery.</p>

<p>“Case No. 2. L. was a child aged eight months, suffering
from a very violent attack of entero-colitis. For three weeks
previous to coming under our notice the patient received
brandy, stimulating foods and alkaline mixtures. Fearfully
emaciated, temperature 106, feeble pulse 182, frequent bloody
discharges from the bowels, numbering as much as thirty in a
day and constant vomiting, the child was considered beyond
hope. Under these circumstances, and at this time we first
saw her. Brandy and all foods were stopped; bowel flushings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>were given, 1-12 of a drop of tincture of aconite was administered
every half hour and salicylate of caffeine every two hours.
In twenty-four hours the temperature was 105 and the pulse
160. In two days, temperature was 102 and the pulse 140. In
one week, temperature was 99 5-10, pulse 110. In three weeks,
the patient was discharged cured.</p>

<p>“Case No. 3. Mrs. C., aged forty-three, who had been under
treatment for seven weeks for <a name="Page_53t" id="Page_53t"></a><a href="#Page_53tn">metrorrhagia</a>, nietortes and peritonitis
came under our notice. Brandy which had been previously
given in large quantities had proved of no avail and the
patient was considered beyond recovery. We found her completely
prostrated, temperature 102, pulse 170, and unconscious.
The heart very weak and irregular. The brandy was discontinued,
salicylate of caffeine and nitrate of strychnia were
given with the result that in a short time the patient was convalescent
and finally recovered.</p>

<p>“Each case in our hospital is an additional proof that
whether found in wines, spirits or beers, alcohol can claim no
right as an indispensable medicine.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Lesser, who was Surgeon-General of the
American Red Cross in the Cuban War said after
his return from his first visit to Cuba that four out
of six of his patients, to whom he allowed liquor to
be given as a concession to the popular idea that it
was necessary, died; while subsequently in treating
absolutely without alcohol sixty-three similar cases,
only one died, and he upon the day on which he
was received at the hospital.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOL IN OTHER HOSPITALS.</h4>

<p>In the spring of 1909 a circular letter was sent to
some of the best known hospitals throughout the coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>try
asking if the use of alcoholic liquors had decreased
in those institutions during the past ten years. From
the replies received the following statements are
taken:</p>

<p>Cook County Hospital, Chicago, sent figures for
two years only, 1907, and 1908. With 28,932 patients
treated in 1907, the bill for wines and liquors
amounted to only $719.40. In 1908 with 31,202
patients the bill for liquors amounted to $970.65. This
makes a <i>per capita</i> expenditure for liquors for 1907
of .024 cents, and for 1908 a <i>per capita</i> expenditure
of .031 cents. The <i>per capita</i> expenditure for liquors
during the same years in Bellevue and Allied Hospitals
of New York city, with from 30,000 to 40,000 patients
treated was .0246 and .029. Two or three cents as
the yearly <i>per capita</i> expenditure for alcoholic liquors
in the two largest hospitals in America is striking evidence
that the physicians practicing there have not
large faith in whisky, or other alcoholic liquors as
remedial agents.</p>

<p>Long Island, N. Y., State Hospital:&mdash;“We are not
using more than half the amount of alcohol we used
ten years ago.”</p>

<p>Manhattan State Hospital, Ward’s Island, New
York City:&mdash;“Our patient population has averaged
nearly 4,500 the last four years, and we have had about
750 employees, many of whom are prescribed for by
institution physicians. The <i>per capita</i> cost of distilled
liquors for the last fiscal year was .0273 at this hospital.”</p>

<p>Milwaukee City Hospital:&mdash;“No alcoholic liquors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>are used to any extent in this hospital, or prescribed
by the staff. I know of no move against such use of
liquors, but venture the assertion that the physicians
believe they have more reliable agents at their command
for most cases.”</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia:&mdash;“We are
now using about one-third the amount of liquor that
was used in the Pennsylvania Hospital ten years ago.”</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Hospital of Philadelphia sent figures
for the years from 1900 to 1908. Those for 1900
show the cost of liquors to be $774.20 and for 1908
only $331.48. The number of patients was not given.</p>

<p>Grady Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia:&mdash;“That less
liquor is now used than formerly is a fact well known
to all connected with the institution.”</p>

<p>Garfield Memorial, Washington, D. C., sent figures
for ten years. For 1899 the cost of liquors was
$490.08, with a steady decrease to 1908 when the cost
was $274.58. Number of patients in 1899 was 1,171;
in 1908, 1,898 patients. The <i>per capita</i> for 1908 was
.144 cents.</p>

<p>University Hospital, Ann Arbor, Michigan:&mdash;“Very
little alcohol is prescribed in this hospital.”</p>

<p>Maine General Hospital, Portland:&mdash;“Comparatively
speaking, we use but little alcohol for the reason
that we now have many remedies which, especially for
continued use, are superior to alcohol, which twenty
years ago we did not have. For the conditions or
emergencies in which we think alcohol has a value it is
used when required or deemed best.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Buffalo, New York, State Hospital sent figures for
six years which include cost of alcohol used in the
manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations, which, of
course, makes a very decided difference. <i>Per capita</i>
for 1903 was 22 cents; for 1908 it was 18 cents.</p>

<p>Buffalo, New York, General Hospital:&mdash;“The use
of alcohol as a drug in this hospital has diminished
about one-third in the past ten years, but I wish to
add in this connection that the use of all drugs has
diminished in this hospital, and to the best of my
knowledge in other institutions of a like character.
The use of the microscope, and other studies have
advanced the science of medicine the same as all other
branches of learning, and other methods are coming
to be used beside the use of drugs.”</p>

<p>Mount Sinai, New York City:&mdash;“The use of alcoholic
beverages here for medical purposes is the exception
rather than the rule. The majority of our cases
are surgical cases, and in these alcoholic liquors are
rarely prescribed for any purpose whatsoever.”</p>

<p>Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital, Boston, sent
figures for five years. For 1904 the cost of alcoholic
liquors was $197.69 with 3,720 patients; for 1908, the
cost was $69.82 with 4,543 patients. The <i>per capita</i>
cost for the five years is as follows: 1904, cost .0531
cents; 1905, cost .0474; 1906, cost .034; 1907, cost
.0171; 1908, cost .0153.</p>

<p>In the <i>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</i> of
April 15, 1909, Dr. Richard C. Cabot gave a table showing
the decrease in the use of alcoholic liquors, and of
other drugs in Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.</p>

<p>Dr. Cabot says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Since there has been no fall in the price of stimulants or
medicine, the diminished expenditure corresponds to a diminution
in the number of doses of medicine and stimulants,
and indicates a rapid and striking change of view among the
members of the staff of the hospital, especially in the past
five years, when it has become generally known that alcohol
is not a stimulant but a narcotic and that drugs can cure
only about half a dozen of the diseases against which we are
contending.</p>

<p>“There has been during this period no increase in the proportion
of surgical cases among the whole number treated,
so that the decreased use of medicines and alcoholic beverages
has not resulted from an increased resort to surgical
remedies. On the other hand, there has been a great increase
in the utilization of baths (hydrotherapeutics), of
massage, of mechanical treatment and of psychical treatment,
all of which accounts no doubt for part of the falling off in
the use of alcohol and drugs.”</p></div>

<h3>THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL UPON THE
HUMAN BODY.</h3>


<p>The body is made up mainly of cells, fibres and
fluids. The cell is the most important structure in
the living body. Life resides in the cell, and every
animal may be considered a mass of cells, each of
which is alive, and each of which has its own work
to accomplish in the building up of the body.</p>

<p>The matter which forms the mass of a cell is called
protoplasm, or bioplasm. It resembles somewhat
the white of a raw egg, which is almost pure albumen.
Cells make up the body, and do its work. Some are
employed to construct the skeleton, others are used
to form the organs which move the body; liver-cells
secrete bile, and the cells in the kidneys separate
poisonous matters from the blood in order that they
may be expelled from the system.</p>

<p>These cells, composing the mass of the body,
being very delicate, are easily acted upon by substances
coming into contact with them. If substances
other than natural foods or drinks are
introduced into the body, the cells are injuriously
affected. Alcohol is especially injurious to cells,
“retarding the changes in their interior, hindering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>their appropriation of food, and elimination of
waste matters, and therefore preventing their
proper development and growth.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Bioplasm is living matter; it is structureless, semi-fluid,
transparent and colorless. It is the only matter that can grow,
move, divide itself and multiply, the only matter that can take
up pabulum (food) and convert it into its own substance; and is
the only matter that can be nourished. The bioplasm in the
cell gets its nourishment by drawing in of the pabulum through
the cell wall, and in that way building up the formed material
while it is being disintegrated on the outer surface. This process
is continually being carried on, and is what is meant by
nutrition. Disintegration of the formed material is as essential
as the building up of it. All organic structure is the result of
change taking place in bioplasm. These small cell-like bioplasts
are the workmen of the organism. All wounds are
repaired by them, all fractures are united, and all diseased tissues
brought back to their normal and healthy condition, unless
there is not vitality enough to overcome disease, or they have
been injured or killed by poisonous material. The body is kept
in repair by this living matter, and all the functions of the body
are but the result of its action. We may examine, watch and
study bioplasm under the microscope; we see it take up pabulum
and convert that which is adapted to itself into its own substance,
while all other substances are rejected. We take a
solution of what we call a stimulant and immerse the bioplasm
in it, and we find that it increases its activity, moves faster, takes
up more pabulum, and divides more rapidly than in the unstimulated
condition. We next add an astringent, and it begins to
move more slowly, and soon contracts into a spherical shape
and remains contracted, or may move slowly to a limited extent,
depending on the strength of the solution. We next take
a relaxant, and gradually the living matter begins to spread in
all directions, in a laxy-like manner, and becomes so thin as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>be almost undiscernible, and takes up very little, if any, pabulum.
If sufficiently relaxed or astringed, the movements may
entirely cease so as to appear lifeless, but when a stimulant is
again added the same result is obtained as before&mdash;it begins to
move, and acts as vigorous as ever, which shows that it was
not injured in the least by the agents used. Alcohol is called a
stimulant. We take a weak solution of alcohol and try it in the
same way; but we find that almost instantly the living matter
contracts into a ball-like mass. Now, we may through ignorance
suppose that alcohol acts as an astringent, and so we try
to stimulate it with the same harmless agent before used, but
no impression is made on it; it does not move; it is dead matter.
These are demonstrable facts, and lie at the foundation of
physiology, pathology and the practice of medicine. Alcohol
destroys the very life force that alone keeps the body in repair.
For a more simple experiment as to the action of alcohol, take
the white of an egg (which consists of albumen, and is very
similar to bioplasm), put it into alcohol, and notice it turn
white, coagulate and harden. The same experiment can be
made with blood with the same result&mdash;killing the blood bioplasts.
Raw meat will turn white and harden in alcohol. Alcohol
acts the same on food in the stomach as it does on the
same substances before introduced into the stomach, and acts
just the same on blood and all the living tissues in the system
as out of it; and this alone is enough to condemn its use as a
medicine.” From <i>Alcohol, Is It a Medicine?</i> by W. F. Pechuman,
M. D., of Detroit, Michigan.</p></div>


<h4>ALCOHOL AND STOMACH DIGESTION.</h4>

<p>The nitrogenous portions of the food are the
only ones digested in the stomach. The oily and
fatty, as well as the starchy portions, are digested
in the small intestines.</p>

<p>Very little was known about digestion until 1833,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>when Dr. Beaumont published the results of his
investigations upon the stomach of Alexis St.
Martin. St. Martin received a severe wound in the
left side from a shot-gun. The wound in healing
left an opening into the stomach about ⅘ of an
inch in diameter, closed on the inside by a flap of
mucous membrane. Through this opening the
interior of the stomach could be thoroughly examined.
Dr. Beaumont made hundreds of observations
upon this young man, who was in his home several
years. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In a feverish condition, from whatever cause, obstructed
perspiration, <i>excitement by alcoholic liquors</i>, overloading the
stomach with food, fear, anger or whatever depresses or disturbs
the nervous system, the lining of the stomach becomes
somewhat red and dry, at other times pale and moist, and loses
its smooth and healthy appearance, the secretions become
vitiated, greatly diminished or entirely suppressed.”</p></div>

<p>One day after giving St. Martin a good wholesome
dinner, digestion of which was going on in
regular order, Dr. Beaumont gave him a glass of
gin. The digestive process was at once arrested,
and did not begin again until after the absorption
of the spirit, after which it was slowly renewed,
and tardily finished.</p>

<p>Gluzinski made some conclusive experiments
with a syphon. He drew off the contents of the
stomach at various times with and without liquor.
He concluded that alcohol entirely suspends the
transformation of food while it remains in the
stomach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Figg, of Edinburgh, fed two dogs with roast
mutton; to one of them he gave 1½ounces of
spirit. Three hours later he killed both dogs.
The dog without liquor had digested the mutton;
the other had not digested his at all. Similar
experiments have been made repeatedly with like
result.</p>

<p>The elements of our food which the stomach can
digest depend upon the pepsin of the gastric juice
for their transformation. Alcohol diminishes the
secretions of the gastric juice, unless given in very
minute quantities, and kills and precipitates its
pepsin. It also coagulates both albumen and
fibrine, converting them into a solid substance,
thus rendering them unfit for the action of the
solvent principles of the gastric juice. Hence, any
considerable quantity of alcohol taken into the
stomach must for the time retard the function of
digestion.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been made with gastric
juice in vials, one, having alcohol added, the other,
not having alcohol. The meat in the vials without
alcohol, in time dissolved till it bore the appearance
of soup; in the vials to which alcohol was added
the meat remained practically unchanged. In the
latter a deposit of pepsin was found at the bottom,
the alcohol having precipitated it. Dr. Henry
Munroe, of England, one of the experimenters in
this line of research, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol, even in a diluted form, has the peculiar power of
interfering with the ordinary process of digestion.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>“As long as alcohol remains in the stomach in any degree
of concentration, the process of digestion is arrested, and is not
continued until enough gastric juice is thrown out to overcome
its effects.”&mdash;<i>Tracy’s Physiology</i>, page 90.</p></div>

<p>In <i>The Human Body</i>, Dr. Newell Martin says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A vast number of persons suffer from alcoholic dyspepsia
without knowing its cause; people who were never drunk in
their lives and consider themselves very temperate. Abstinence
from alcohol, the cause of the trouble, is the true remedy.”</p></div>

<p>Sir B. W. Richardson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The common idea that alcohol acts as an aid to digestion
is without foundation. Experiments on the artificial digestion
of food, in which the natural process is closely imitated, show
that the presence of alcohol in the solvents employed interferes
with and weakens the efficacy of the solvents. It is also one of
the most definite of facts that persons who indulge even in
what is called the moderate use of alcohol suffer often from
dyspepsia from this cause alone. In fact, it leads to the symptoms
which, under the varied names of biliousness, nervousness,
lassitude and indigestion, are so well and extensively
known.</p>

<p>“From the paralysis of the minute blood-vessels which is
induced by alcohol, there occurs, when alcohol is introduced
into the stomach, injection of the vessels and redness of the
mucous lining of the stomach. This is attended by the subjective
feeling of a warmth or glow within the body, and
according to some, with an increased secretion of the gastric
fluids. It is urged by the advocates of alcohol that this action
of alcohol on the stomach is a reason for its employment as an
aid to digestion, especially when the digestive powers are
feeble. At best this argument suggests only an artificial aid,
which it cannot be sound practice to make permanent in place
of the natural process of digestion. In truth, the artificial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>stimulation, if it be resorted to even moderately, is in time
deleterious. It excites a morbid habitual craving, and in the
end leads to weakened contractile power of the vessels of the
stomach, to consequent deficiency of control of those vessels
over the current of blood, to organic impairment of function,
and to confirmed indigestion. Lastly, it is a matter of experience
with me, that in nine cases out of ten, the sense of the
necessity, on which so much is urged, is removed in the
readiest manner, by the simple plan of total abstinence, without
any other remedy or method.”</p></div>

<p>In <i>Medicinal Drinking</i>, by John Kirk, M. D., this
passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Especially in the matter of support, it is essential to our
inquiry to examine fully into alcoholic influence on the change
by which food introduced into the stomach becomes capable of
passing into the circulation and constituent elements of the
living frame. It may be best to suppose a case for illustration.
Here, then, is a child of, say, six or seven years of age. This
child is of the slenderer sex and has been brought into a state of
extreme weakness as the consequence of fever. The fury of
the disease is expended, but it has, as nearly as may be, extinguished
life. The medical man’s one hope for saving this
child is now concentrated in what he fancies to be ‘support.’
Beef-tea, arrowroot and <i>port wine</i> are prescribed. Let it be
kept in mind that the pure wine of the grape is discarded in
favor of alcoholic wine. Our question is, What effect will the
alcohol in this wine have on that process by which the food is
to prove really nourishing, and so to be that support which is
the only hope for this child? Will it help her? or will it so
hinder the necessary change in the food as to kill her, unless
she has sufficient strength left to get above its influence?
These are surely important questions. Neither of them can be
set at rest by the fact that she recovers; for she <i>may</i> have
strength enough, as many have had, to survive even a serious
error in her treatment.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>“What light, then, does true science throw on these important
questions? All who know anything on the subject are aware
that alcohol, instead of dissolving <i>food</i>, or aiding in its dissolution,
is one of the most powerful agents in preventing that
dissolution. On what principle, then, is it possible that its
being mixed with the materials of food, in this case, can aid in
their dissolution, so that they may more easily be changed into
the fresh blood required to sustain and recover life in this
child?”</p></div>

<p>He then refers to the experiments with gastric
juice in vials, and proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Here, then, is indisputable evidence that alcohol effectually
<i>prevents</i> that process which is known as digestion, and which
is essential to food’s being of any use to support life in man.
On what principle can the physician explain his introduction of
it into the stomach of a child whose thread of life is attenuated
to the slenderest hair?</p>

<p>“We urge the chemical truth that the alcohol, given to promote
support, is of such a nature as to prevent that which
would nourish, from effecting the end so much to be desired,
and for which true food is adapted.”</p></div>

<p>The pure, unfermented juice of the grape, free
from chemical preservatives, is now used by many
physicians where the miserable concoction of drugs
and alcohol, known as port wine, was once considered
essential. Unfermented grape juice contains
all the nutriment of the grape, without any of
the poison, alcohol. After being opened it should
be kept in a cool place, or it will ferment and produce
alcohol. Fruit juices are very grateful to a
fever patient, and should not be withheld as they
are in so many cases. Dr. J. H. Kellogg, and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>non-alcoholic physicians, recommend them highly.
They are better than milk, as milk frequently produces
“feverishness,” while fruit juices allay it.</p>

<p>For those who think beer or ale an incentive to
appetite, Dr. N. S. Davis, and others, recommend
an infusion of hops, made fresh each day. It is the
bitter which promotes appetite, not the alcohol.
For the sake of the little bitter in beer, it is not
wise to vitiate the tone of the stomach with the
alcohol it contains, and which is its active principle.
Many mothers have become drunkards, secret
drunkards, possibly, through the use of beer as a
fancied aid to digestion. Multitudes of men suffer
untold horrors from dyspepsia, caused by the beer
which they mistakenly suppose to be a friend to
their stomach.</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL UPON THE BLOOD.</h4>

<p>“The blood is a thick, opaque fluid, varying in
color in different parts of the body from a bright
scarlet to a dark purple, or even almost black.” If
a drop of blood be placed under a microscope, immense
numbers of small bodies will be seen. These
are called blood-globules, or corpuscles, or discs.
There are both red, and white or colorless, corpuscles.
Each red corpuscle is soft and jelly-like.
Its chief constituent, besides water, is a substance
called hemoglobin, which has the power of combining
with oxygen when in a place where that gas is
plentiful, and of giving it off again in a region
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>where oxygen is absent, or present only in small
quantity. Hence, as the blood flows through the
lungs, which are constantly supplied with fresh air,
its corpuscles take up oxygen, which, as it flows on,
is carried by them to distant parts of the body
where oxygen is deficient, and there given up to
the tissues. This oxygen-carrying is the function
of the red corpuscles.</p>

<p>Hemoglobin, as the coloring-matter of the blood
is called, is dark purplish-red in color; combined
with oxygen it is bright “scarlet red.” Accordingly,
the blood which flows to the lungs after giving
up its oxygen is dark red in color, its dark
color being due to the impurities it contains; and
that which, having received a fresh supply of oxygen,
flows away from the lungs is bright scarlet&mdash;having
been cleansed of its impurities. The bright
red blood is called <i>arterial</i>, and the dark red <i>venous</i>.</p>

<p>The work assigned to the blood in the economy
of the human system is: first, to pick up nutriment
in its course through the walls of the alimentary
canal, and oxygen, as it flows through the lungs,
and convey these to all other parts of the body.
Second, to act as a sort of sewage stream that
drains off waste matter, and to carry this to the
organs of excretion by which waste is expelled
from the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The blood is the great circulating market of the body, in
which all the things that are wanted by all parts, by the muscles,
the brain, the skin, the lungs, liver and kidneys, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>bought and sold. What the muscles want they buy from the
blood; what they have done with, they sell back to the blood;
and so with every other organ and part. As long as life lasts
this buying and selling is forever going on, and this is why the
blood is forever on the move, sweeping restlessly from place to
place, bringing to each part the thing it wants, and carrying
away those with which it has done. When the blood ceases to
move, the market is blocked, the buying and selling cease, and
all the organs die, starved for lack of the things they want,
choked by the abundance of things for which they have no
longer any need.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Foster.</span></p></div>

<p>This is one way of saying that the processes of
repair and waste are constantly going on in the
body. Every action of the body, every impulse of
the mind uses up some cell-matter, which must
then be passed from the body as waste. This is
called tissue disintegration. New cells to repair
tissue waste are built up from the nutriment which
the blood carries from the alimentary canal after
the process of food digestion is accomplished.
This is called tissue construction, or the process of
assimilation. Technically, these are the metabolic,
or destructive and constructive processes. Both
are essential to health and life. Any substance
taken into the body, which will interfere with these
processes of nutrition and waste is inimical to
health, and in time of disease, dangerous to life.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol is such a substance.</i></p>

<p>The cells and tissues of the body which are
touched by alcohol are more or less hardened and
injured by it, hence are less perfectly nourished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>than they are when alcohol is not present in the
blood. Even a teaspoonful of alcohol to a ½ gallon
of water hinders natural growth. If liquor is given
to puppies it keeps them small. Young growing-cells
are most affected by it, because they are most
tender. There are growing-cells in adults as well
as in children, for people are growing and changing
all through their lives.</p>

<p>Hence, when alcohol is administered in sickness
the cells are hindered in the full performance of
their function of taking up food for the building up
of tissue, and as a consequence, the patient’s body
is really robbed of nutriment by the agent which is
supposed to be “keeping up his strength.” Truly,
“Wine is a <i>mocker</i>, strong drink is raging, and whosoever
is <i>deceived</i> thereby is not wise.”</p>

<p>That alcohol interferes with the passage of waste
matter from the body is generally conceded. Indeed
this is claimed by the advocates of its medicinal
use as one of its virtues: the fact that less
waste passes from the body being urged as evidence
that there is less waste, that in some way alcohol
preserves tissue from being used up in the natural
way. Those who speak thus seem to think that
they know better than the Creator how the body
should be treated. He made the body so that in
health, work, waste and repair should be equal to
one another.</p>

<p>Dr. Ezra M. Hunt says in <i>Alcohol as a Food and
as a Medicine</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We believe that any one who will candidly review the
claims put forth for alcohol, in that it delays in any of these
hypothetical ways, tissue-change, will conclude that it has no
such power <i>in a salutary sense</i>, and that it is unwarrantably
assumed that to retard tissue metamorphosis (change) is
equivalent to tissue nutrition.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It seems hardly possible that men of eminent attainments
in the profession should so far forget one of the most fundamental
and universally recognized laws of organic life as to promulgate
the fallacy here stated. The fundamental law to
which we refer is, that all vital phenomena are accompanied by,
and dependent upon, molecular or atomic changes; and whatever
retards these retards the phenomena of life; whatever suspends
these suspends life. Hence, to say that an agent which
retards tissue metamorphosis is in any sense a food, is simply
to pervert and misapply terms.”</p></div>

<p>Non-alcoholic physicians unite in declaring that
the retention of waste matter in the system, caused
by alcohol, invites disease, and tends to inflammatory
action; and in illness retards, and frequently
prevents, recovery, for the germs of disease remain
longer in the body than they would were it not for
the delay in the passage of effete matter.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol not only hinders the blood in its work of
tissue nutrition; it also prevents the full oxidation of
the blood in the lungs.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In order that a steam engine may work and keep warm it
is not merely necessary that it have plenty of coal, but it must
also have a draft of air through its furnace. Chemistry teaches
us that the burning in this case consists in the combination of a
gas called oxygen, taken from the air, with other things in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>coals; when this combination takes place a great deal of heat is
given off. The same thing is true of our bodies; in order that
food matters may be burnt in them and enable us to work and
keep warm, they must be supplied with oxygen; this they get
from the air by breathing. We all know that if his supply of
air be cut off a man will die in a few minutes. His food is no
use to him unless he gets oxygen from the air to combine
with it; while he usually has stored up in his body an excess
of food matters which will keep him alive for some time if he
gets a supply of oxygen, he has not stored up in him any reserve,
or, if any, but a very small one, of oxygen, and so he dies
very rapidly if his breathing be prevented. In ordinary language
we do not call oxygen a food, but restrict that name to
the solids and liquids which we swallow; but inasmuch as it is
a material which we must take from the external universe into
our bodies in order to keep us alive, oxygen is really a food as
much as any of the other substances which we take into our
bodies from outside, in order to keep them alive and at work.
<i>Suffocation</i>, as death from deficient air supply is named, is
really death from oxygen-starvation.”&mdash;Martin’s <i>Human Body</i>.</p></div>

<p>Much of the food taken into the body is burned
to supply energy and heat. This burning is called
oxidation. When food is burned, or oxidized, either
in the body, or out of it, three things are produced,
carbon dioxide (<i>carbonic acid gas</i>), water and
ashes. These are waste matters, and must be expelled
from the body, or they will clog up the various
organs, as the ashes and smoke of an engine
would soon put its fire out if they were allowed to
accumulate in the furnace. It is the duty of the
lungs to pass the carbon dioxide out to the air.
With every breath exhaled, this poison gas, generated
in the body through the oxidation of food,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>passes from the system. With every breath inhaled
the life-giving oxygen is taken into the body; providing
that the person is not in a close room from
which the fresh air is excluded.</p>

<p>Any substance taken into the body which interferes
with the reception of oxygen into the blood,
and with the giving off of carbon dioxide from
the same is a dangerous substance.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol is such a substance.</i></p>

<p>It has already been stated that it is the duty of
the little red corpuscles in the blood to take up
oxygen in the lungs, and carry it to every part of
the body, and upon the return passage to the lungs
to convey the <i>débris</i>, or used-up material, from the
tissues, called carbon dioxide gas. A little vapor
and ammonia accompany this gas. The action of
alcohol upon these little corpuscles, or carriers of
the blood, is to somewhat harden and shrivel them,
so that they are unable to take up and carry as
much oxygen as they can when no injurious substance
is present in the blood. In consequence of
this, the blood can never be so pure when alcohol is
present, as it may be in the absence of this agent.</p>

<p>The following is taken from <i>The Temperance
Lesson Book</i>, by B. W. Richardson, M. D.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When the blood in the veins is floating toward the right
side of the heart, which communicates with the lungs, it carries
with it the carbonic acid (<i>carbon dioxide</i>), and, as I have found
by experiment, a great part of this gas is condensed in these
little bodies, the corpuscles. Arrived at the lungs, the blood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>comes into such contact with the air we breathe, that the
oxygen gas in the air is freely absorbed by the little corpuscles,
while the carbonic acid is given up into the air-passages of the
lungs, and is thrown off with every breath we throw out. In
this process the blood changes in color. It comes into the
lungs of a dark color; it goes out of them a bright red. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
The parts of the blood on which alcohol acts injuriously are the
corpuscles and the fibrine. The red corpuscles are most distinctly
affected. They undergo a peculiar process of shrinking
from extraction of water from them. They also lose some
of their power to absorb oxygen from the air. In confirmed
spirit-drinkers the face and hands are often seen of dark
mottled color, and in very bad specimens of the kind, the face
is sometimes seen to be quite dark. This is because the blood
cannot take up the vital air in the natural degree. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“If anything whatever interferes with the proper reception of
oxygen by the blood, the blood is not properly oxidized, the
animal warmth is not sufficiently maintained, and life is reduced
in activity. If for a brief interval of time the process of breathing
is stopped in a living person, we see quickly developed the
signs of difficulty, and we say the person is being suffocated.
We observe that the face becomes dark, the lips blue, the
surface cold. Should the process of arrest or stoppage of the
breathing be long continued the person will become unconscious,
will stagger and fall, and should relief not be at hand,
he will in a very few minutes die.</p>

<p>“I found by experiment that in presence of alcohol in blood
the process of absorption of oxygen was directly checked, and
that even so minute a quantity as one part of alcohol in five
hundred of blood proved an obstacle to the perfect reception of
oxygen by the blood. The corpuscles are reduced in size,
when large quantities of alcohol are taken, and become irregular
in shape.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge says in <i>Addresses on the Physiological
Action of Alcohol</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It has been found by experiment that, when alcohol is
taken, less carbonic acid comes away in the breath than when
it is not. This is partly because the blood-corpuscles cannot
carry so much, and partly because so much is not produced,
because there is less oxygen to join with the food and produce
it. Just as burning paper smokes when it does not get enough
oxygen, so other things are formed and get into the blood when
there is not enough oxygen to make carbonic acid. These
things make the blood impure, and cause extra work and
trouble to get rid of them. This is why persons who drink
alcohol are more liable to have gout and other diseases, than
total abstainers.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Alfred Carpenter, formerly president of the
Council of the British Medical Association, says in
<i>Alcoholic Drinks</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A blood corpuscle cannot come into direct contact with an
atom of alcohol, without the function of the former being
spoiled, and not only is it spoiled, but the effete matter which
it has within its capsule cannot be exchanged for the necessary
oxygen. The breath of the drunken man does not give out
the quantity of carbonic acid which that of the healthy man does,
and the ammoniacal compounds are in a great measure absent.
Some of the carbon and effete nitrogenous matter is kept back.
The retention of these poisonous matters within the body is
highly injurious. Let the drinker suffer from any wound or
injury and this effete matter in his blood is ready at a moment’s
notice to prepare and set up actions called inflammatory or
erysipelatous, or some other kind; by means of which too
often the drinker is hurried into eternity, although, perhaps,
he may have been regarded as a perfectly sober man, and have
never been drunk in his life.”</p></div>

<p>In the light of these scientific facts, what can
appear more utterly foolish than the swallowing of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>alcoholic patent medicines which are widely advertised
as “Blood Purifiers”? That they will render
the blood impure is only too evident in the
light of scientific truth.</p>

<p>Dr. Nathan S. Davis has written much in disapproval
of the use of alcohol in fevers, pneumonia
and diphtheria, putting stress upon the fact that
these diseases, of themselves, interfere with the
reception of oxygen into the blood, and hence the
use of all remedies that notably diminish the
internal distribution of oxygen, or impair the corpuscles
of the blood, should be avoided. Not only
is alcohol of such a nature, but all the coal-tar
series of antipyretics also. Since the internal distribution
of oxygen, and the processes of tissue
change are essential to the repair of the body, and
alcohol hinders the blood in the full performance
of its duties in these respects, it certainly seems
clear that those physicians, who are extremely
cautious in the use of this drug, or who do not use
it at all, are more likely to be successful in saving
their patients than are those who use it freely.
Death-rates, with and without alcohol, show conclusively
the superiority of the latter treatment.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOL AND THE HEART.</h4>

<p>The organs of circulation are the heart and the
blood-vessels. The blood-vessels are of three kinds,
arteries, capillaries and veins. The arteries carry
blood from the heart to the capillaries; the veins
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>collect it from the capillaries and return it to the
heart. There are two distinct sets of blood-vessels
in the body, both connected with the heart; one set
carries blood to, through and from the lungs, the
other guides its flow through all the remaining
organs; the former are known as the <i>pulmonary</i>,
the latter as the <i>systemic</i> blood-vessels.</p>

<p>The smallest arteries pass into the <i>capillaries</i>,
which have very thin walls, and form very close networks
in nearly all parts of the body; their immense
number compensating for their small size. It is
while flowing in these delicate tubes that the blood
does its nutritive work, the arteries being merely
supply-tubes for the capillaries, through whose
delicate walls liquid containing nourishment exudes
from the blood to bathe the various tissues.</p>

<p>The quantity of blood in any part of the body at
any given time is dependent upon certain relations
which exist between the blood-vessels and the nervous
system. The walls of the arteries are abundantly
supplied with involuntary muscular fibres,
which have the power of contraction and relaxation.
This power of contraction and relaxation is controlled
by certain nerves called <i>vasomotor</i> nerves,
because they cause or control motion in the vessels
to which they are attached. When arteries supplying
blood to any particular part of the body contract,
the supply of blood to that part will be diminished
in proportion to the amount of contraction.
If the nervous control be altogether withdrawn, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>arterial walls will completely relax, and the amount
of blood in the part affected will be increased correspondingly.</p>

<p>Alcohol, even in moderate doses, paralyzes the
<i>vasomotor</i> nerves which control the minute blood-vessels,
thus allowing these vessels to become
dilated with the flowing blood.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“With the disturbance of power in the extreme vessels, more
disturbance is set up in other organs, and the first organ that
shares in it is the heart. With each beat of the heart a certain
degree of resistance is offered by the vessels when their nervous
supply is perfect, and the stroke of the heart is moderate
in respect both to tension and to time. But when the vessels
are rendered relaxed, the resistance is removed, the heart begins
to run quicker like a clock from which the pendulum has been
removed, and the heart-stroke is greatly increased in frequency.
It is easy to account in this manner for the quickened heart
and pulse which accompany the first stage of deranged action
from alcohol.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richardson.</span></p></div>

<p>Dr. Parkes of England, assisted by Count
Wollowicz, conducted inquiries upon the effects of
alcohol upon the heart, with a young and healthy
man. At first they made accurate count of the
heart beats during periods when the young man
drank water only; then of the beats during successive
periods in which alcohol was taken in increasing
quantities. Thus step by step they measured the
precise action of alcohol on the heart, and thereby
the precise primary influence induced by alcohol.
Their results are stated by themselves as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The average number of beats of the heart in 24 hours (as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>calculated from eight observations made in 14 hours), during
the first, or water period, was 106,000; in the earlier alcoholic
period it was 127,000, or about 21,000 more; and in the later
period it was 131,000, or 25,000 more.</p>

<p>“The highest of the daily means of the pulse observed during
the first, or water period, was 77.5; but on this day two observations
are deficient. The next highest daily mean was 77
beats.</p>

<p>“If, instead of the mean of the eight days, or 73.57, we compare
the mean of this one day; viz. 77 beats per minute, with
the alcoholic days, so as to be sure not to over-estimate the
action of the alcohol, we find:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the 9th day, with one fluid ounce of alcohol, the heart
beat 4,300 times more.</p>

<p>On the 10th day, with two fluid ounces, 8,172 times more.</p>

<p>On the 11th day, with four fluid ounces, 12,960 times more.</p>

<p>On the 12th day, with six fluid ounces, 20,672 times more.</p>

<p>On the 13th day, with eight fluid ounces, 23,904 times more.</p>

<p>On the 14th day, with eight fluid ounces, 25,488 times
more.</p>

<p>But as there was ephemeral fever on the 12th day, it is right
to make a deduction, and to estimate the number of beats in
that day as midway between the 11th and 13th days, or 18,432.
Adopting this, the mean daily excess of beats during the alcoholic
days was 14,492, or an increase of rather more than 13
per cent.</p>

<p>The first day of alcohol gave an excess of 4 per cent., and
the last of 23 per cent.; and the mean of these two gives almost
the same percentage of excess as the mean of the six days.</p>

<p>Admitting that each beat of the heart was as strong during
the alcoholic period as in the water period (and it was really
more powerful), the heart on the last two days of alcohol was
doing one-fifth more work.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>“Adopting the lowest estimate which has been given of the
daily work of the heart; viz. as equal to 12.2 tons lifted one
foot, the heart during the alcoholic period, did daily work
excess equal to lifting 15.8 tons one foot, and in the last two
days did extra work to the amount of 24 tons lifted as far.</p>

<p>“The period of rest for the heart was shortened, though, perhaps,
not to such an extent as would be inferred from the
number of beats, for each contraction was sooner over. The
heart, on the fifth and sixth days after alcohol was left off, and,
apparently at the time when the last traces of alcohol were
eliminated, showed in the sphygmographic tracing signs of
unusual feebleness; and, perhaps, in consequence of this, when
the brandy quickened the heart again, the tracings showed a
more rapid contraction of the ventricles, but less power than in
the alcoholic period. The brandy acted, in fact, on a heart
whose nutrition had not been perfectly restored.”</p></div>

<p>Richardson quotes these experiments of Parkes
and Wollowicz as if he agrees with them that increased
heart-beat must of necessity mean increased
work done by the heart. Dr. Nathan S. Davis, Dr.
Newell Martin, Dr. A. B. Palmer, and some other
investigators, show conclusively that mere increased
frequency of beat above the natural standard is no
evidence of increased force or efficiency in the circulation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The more frequent beats under the influence of alcohol constitute
no exception to the general rule, for while the heart beats
more frequently, its influence on the vasomotor nerves causes
dilatation of the peripheral and systemic blood-vessels, as
proved by the pulse-line written by the sphygmograph, which
more than counterbalances the supposed increased action of the
heart. The truth is, that under the influence of alcohol in the
blood the systolic action of the heart loses in sustained force in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>direct proportion to its increase in frequency, until, by simply
increasing the proportion of alcohol, the heart stops in diastole,
as perfectly paralyzed as are the coats of the smaller vessels
throughout the system. This was clearly demonstrated by the
experiments of Professor Martin of Johns Hopkins University,
to determine the effects of different proportions of alcohol on
the action of the heart of the dog; and those of Drs. Sidney
Ringer and H. Sainsbury, to determine the relative strength of
different alcohols as indicated by their influence on the heart of
the frog. Professor Martin states that blood containing ¼ per
cent. by volume of absolute alcohol, almost invariably diminishes,
within a minute, the work done by the heart.”</p></div>

<p>(This estimate would equal in an adult man an
amount equal to the absolute alcohol in two or
three ounces of whisky or brandy.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These investigations of Professor Martin, being directly
corroborated by those of Drs. Ringer and Sainsbury, complete
the series of demonstrations needed to show the actual effects
of alcohol on the cardiac, as well as on the vasomotor, and
also on the direct contractability of the muscular structure,
when supplied with blood containing all gradations in the relative
proportion of alcohol, leaving no longer any basis for the
idea, popular both in and out of the profession, that alcohol in
any of its forms is capable of increasing, even temporarily the
force or efficiency of the heart’s action.”&mdash;Dr. N. S. Davis in
<i>Influence of Alcohol On the Human System</i>.</p></div>

<p>The following letter will be of great interest to
all students of the physiological effects of alcohol:&mdash;</p>

<p>“To <span class="smcap">Mrs. Martha M. Allen</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Syracuse, N. Y.,<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>: Your letter asking my attention to the
apparent contradiction of authorities concerning the <i>work</i> done
by the heart when influenced by alcohol was received yesterday.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>“The explanation is not difficult. It depends entirely on the
different views of what constitutes the <i>work</i> of the heart.</p>

<p>“One class of investigators, led by the original and valuable
experiments of Parkes and Wollowicz base their estimate of
the heart’s work entirely on the <i>number of times it contracts or
beats per minute</i>. Thus Dr. Parkes, finding that moderate
doses of alcohol increased the number of contractions of the
heart from three to six beats per minute more than natural,
readily estimated the number of additional contractions that
would occur in twenty-four hours, and thereby demonstrated a
large amount of increased work done by the heart under the
influence of alcohol. All writers who speak of ‘stimulating’ or
increasing the action of the heart by alcohol follow this method
of measuring the amount of <i>work</i> done. They generally add
that it is like applying ‘the whip to a tired horse.’</p>

<p>“The other class of investigators who claim that <i>alcohol</i> diminishes
the actual <i>work</i> done by the heart base their estimates
on the amount <i>of blood the heart passes through its cavities
into the arteries in a given time</i>. This is the physiological
function of the heart; i.e. to aid in circulating the blood.
Professor Martin’s experiments were admirably contrived to
determine, not how frequently the heart beat, but the amount of
blood it delivered per minute under the influence of alcohol and
without alcohol.</p>

<p>“He, and all others who take this basis of work, found that
alcohol in any dose diminished the efficiency of the heart in circulating
the blood in direct ratio to the quantity taken.</p>

<p>“My own original experiments, made fifty years ago, uniformly
showed that alcohol quickly increased the number of
heart beats per minute, but at the same time diminished the
efficiency of the circulation generally. Every experienced practitioner
knows that the weaker the <i>heart</i> becomes, the <i>faster</i> it
beats. Consequently, the number of times the heart contracts
per minute is no measure of the efficiency of its work in circula<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ting
the blood. Indeed the mechanism of the heart is such
that there must be sufficient time between each of its contractions
for its <i>cavities</i> to <i>fill</i>, or it is made to contract on an
insufficient supply, and the efficiency of the circulation is diminished.</p>

<p>The International Medical Congress of 1876
adopted as its reply to the Memorial of the National
Temperance Society, and of the National Woman’s
Christian Temperance Union respecting “Alcohol
as a Food and as a Medicine,” the paper by Dr.
Ezra M. Hunt, one conclusion of which was, “Its
use as a medicine is chiefly that of a cardiac stimulant.”</p>

<p>As experiments conducted since that time show
that it is not a cardiac stimulant, but a direct cardiac
paralyzant, what excuse is there for using it as
a medicine now?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Whenever the heart is compelled to more rapid contraction
than is natural, it has less time to rest. Although it seems to
be constantly at work, it really rests more than half the time,
so that, although the periods of relaxation are very short, they
are so numerous that the aggregate amount of rest in a day is
very great. Now, if the rapidity of the contractions is increased
materially and continuously, although the aggregate amount of
time for rest may be the same as before, yet the waste caused by
the contractions is greater, while the time for rest after each
one is shorter. This lack of rest produces exhaustion of the
heart-muscle, ending in partial change of the muscular tissue
into fat. The heart then becomes flabby and weak and its
walls become thinner, a condition known to physicians as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>‘fatty heart,’ often resulting in sudden death.”&mdash;<i>Tracy’s Physiology</i>,
page 158.</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Hartford, Conn., has made
many observations with the sphygmograph to
learn the effects of alcohol upon the heart. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“On general principles, and clinically, the increased activity
and subsequent diminution of the heart’s action brings no
medicinal aid or strength to combat disease. This is simply a
reckless waste of force for which there is no compensation.
Without any question or doubt the increased heart’s action,
extending over a long period, is dangerous.</p>

<p>“The medicinal damage done by alcohol does not fall exclusively
upon the heart, although this organ may show it more
permanently than others.”&mdash;<i>Transactions of Second Annual
Meeting of A. M. T. A.</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. I. N. Quimby, of Jersey City, N. J., in an
address before the American Medical Temperance
Association, after describing two clinical cases which
ended in death, made the following statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There was nothing so strange about the death of these
two patients, although they both died unexpectedly to the
physician and their friends, but the declaration I am about to
make may be somewhat new and startling, namely: That
neither of these patients, in my candid judgment, died from the
effect of disease, but rather from vasomotor paralysis of the
heart, <i>superinduced by the administration of the alcohol</i>,
which brought on a sudden and unexpected collapse and death.”</p></div>

<p>Alcohol causes fatty degeneration of the heart
and other muscular structures. Old age also
causes these degenerations, hence alcohol is said to
produce premature aging of the body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In fatty degeneration the cells and fibres of the body become
more or less changed into fat. If a muscular fibre undergoes
fatty degeneration, the particles of which it is made disappear
one by one, and particles of oil or fatty matter take
their place, so that the degree or amount of degeneration varies
according to the extent to which this change has gone on.
When the fibres of which a muscle is composed have become
thus altered by fatty degeneration they become softer according
to the amount of it; they are more easily torn and may
even tear across when the muscle is being used during life.
The more a muscle is thus degenerated the weaker it is, because
it contains less muscular substance and more fat. Not
only do the heart and other voluntary muscles thus degenerate,
but those of the arteries also.</p>

<p>“Fatty degeneration is promoted by alcohol because alcohol
prevents the proper removal of fat, which has been seen to
accumulate in the blood; alcohol prevents the proper oxidation
or burning up of waste matters; growing cells which are affected
by the chemical influence of alcohol are not quite natural or
healthy, so are more liable to degeneration; alcohol hinders the
proper removal of waste matter from individual cells and
tissues.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. J. Ridge</span>, London.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Newell Martin says in <i>The Human Body</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Although fatty degeneration of the heart may occur from
other causes, alcoholic indulgence is the most frequent one.
Fatty liver or fatty heart is rarely if ever curable; either will
ultimately cause death.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ridge says these degenerations occur in the
tissues of thin people as well as in those of stout
persons. In thin people they are usually in the
fibres only, not between them.</p>

<p>It is because of this degeneration of the heart
and other muscles caused by alcohol that athletes in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>training need to be so very careful to avoid the use
of beer and other intoxicating drinks.</p>

<p>Diseases such as fevers, diphtheria, and pneumonia
which interfere with the reception, and internal
distribution of oxygen, favor granular and fatty
degeneration of the heart and other structures of
the body. Hence non-alcoholic physicians urge that
alcohol and such other drugs, as have like action in
hindering full oxidation of the blood, and causing
fatty degenerations should be studiously avoided.
These physicians attribute many of the deaths from
heart-failure in such diseases to the combined action
of the disease and the alcohol in exhausting the
heart, and weakening its structure.</p>

<p><i>Comparative death-rates with and without alcohol
show conclusively the superiority of the latter treatment.</i></p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL UPON THE LIVER.</h4>

<p>The liver is a very large organ, the largest and
heaviest in the body, weighing in a healthy adult
from three to four pounds. It secretes the bile.
Its cells also store up, “in the form of a kind of
animal starch called glycogen,” excess of starchy or
sugary food absorbed from the intestine during the
digestion of a meal. This it gradually doles out
to the blood for general use by the organs of the
body until the next meal is eaten.</p>

<p>Dr. William Hargreaves says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The office of the liver is to take up new substances having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>not yet become blood, as well as the portions of integrated
matter that can be worked over, and brought again into use.
It is in fact the economist of the system. It excretes bile, and
liver-sugar, and <i>renews</i> the <i>blood</i>. When the liver is disordered
the whole body is more or less deranged and the proper
nutrition of its parts arrested.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Alfred Carpenter says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The liver has to do several things; a considerable part of its
duty is to purify the blood from <i>débris</i> (waste matter), to filter
out some things, to break up and alter others, and to expel
them from the body in the form of bile. There are certain diseases
in which the liver suddenly declines to do any more work.
Acute atrophy of the liver is the name of this condition, and
when it arises death rapidly results from suppression of the secretion
of bile. It brings about a state of things called <i>acholia</i>;
the patient is actually poisoned by the non-removal of those ingredients
from the blood which it is the duty of the liver to remove.
This corresponds in effect to the condition which alcohol
can bring about by slow degrees.”</p></div>

<p>The liver is the first important organ, next to the
stomach and bowels, to receive the poisonous influence
of alcohol.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If alcohol is used habitually, though only in small quantities
at a time, the liver may become the seat of serious changes.
There may be a great increase of fat deposited in the cells,
producing what is called ‘fatty liver,’ or it may lead to a great
increase of connective tissue (membrane) between the cells, and
surrounding the blood-vessels. This newly-developed connective
tissue gradually contracts, and in so doing crushes the
cells and obstructs the blood-vessels, making the organ much
smaller than natural, and causing the surface to be covered
with little projecting knobs, consisting of portions of liver-tissue
that have been less compressed than the part that separates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>them. The pressure upon the liver-cells and the destruction of
many of them, prevents the proper formation of bile and liver-sugar.
The contraction of the newly-developed tissue, by obstructing
the blood-vessels, interferes with the circulation.
Malt liquors seem to produce fatty degeneration, while the
stronger liquors cause the development of connective tissue.”&mdash;<i>Tracy’s
Physiology.</i></p></div>

<p>Speaking of diseases of the liver, Dr. Trotter said
in his <i>Essay on Drunkenness</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The chronic species is not a painful disease; it is slow in
its progress, and frequently gives no alarm, till some incurable
affection is the consequence. Hence, the fallacy and danger of
judging merely by the feelings of the beneficial effects of the
use of intoxicating drinks; for the liver and stomach may be
seriously diseased, while a man imagines himself in moderate
health.”</p></div>

<p>Hardening of the liver, or “hob-nailed” liver, is
said to be the result, largely, of taking liquor upon
an empty stomach. Dr. E. Chenery, of Boston, in
his excellent book, <i>Facts for the Millions</i>, tells of a
patient of his who was well up to the evening before,
when he went out and drank with some companions,
taking the liquor on an empty stomach.
That night, vomiting and pain in the right side
came on, with high fever. Headache began and increased,
followed by delirium and a general jaundiced
condition. He died as a result. The disease
was acute inflammation of the liver, brought on by
the one broadside of alcohol poured “point blank”
into the organ.</p>

<p>Dr. Chenery says further on in the same book:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is another disorder of a very serious nature which
science is now laying at the doors of the liver&mdash;<i>diabetes mellitus</i>,
or sugar in the urine. Till quite recently, this formidable affection
has been regarded as having its seat in the kidneys;
and it is so classified in medical writings. Later researches,
however, show that the sugar has been formed in the economy
before it reaches the kidneys, and that these organs act only as
strainers with respect to it, removing it from the blood as they
remove salt and various other substances. In seeking for the
fountain-head of diabetic sugar, it is found that the liver is the
great glycogenic, or sugar-originating factory of the body. In
an ordinary state of health this substance is produced in just
the proper amount for the uses for which it is intended, so that
it is all disposed of in the organism, and does not pass off by
the kidneys. If any cause interrupts the processes by which
the sugar is consumed, while its manufacture goes on normally,
there will come to be an over-supply of sugar in the blood,
which, when it reaches 3 parts to 1,000 of the blood, will begin
to pass off by the kidneys and appear in the urine. On the
other hand, if an undue amount of it is formed, the consumption
remaining normal, it will also accumulate in the circulation, and
be eliminated by the kidneys. In either case we have diabetes,
the sugar irritating and diseasing the kidneys as it passes.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Harley, of the Royal Society of London, has
made the subject of alcohol and diabetes matter for
considerable study. He says a small quantity only
of alcohol injected into the portal (liver) circulation
of healthy animals will cause diabetic urine.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If any one doubt the truth of the assertion that alcohol
causes diabetes, let him select a case of that form of the disease
arising from excessive formation, and after having carefully estimated
the daily amount of sugar eliminated by the patient,
allow him to drink a few glasses of wine, and watch the result.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>He will soon find the ingestion of the liquor is followed by an
increase of sugar. If alcoholics increase the amount of saccharine
matter in the urine of the diabetic, we can easily understand
how their excessive use may induce the disease in
individuals <i>predisposed</i> to it.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Harley.</span></p></div>

<p>Some physicians claim that in jaundice and certain
other bilious disorders even medicines prepared
in alcohol are decidedly prejudicial and aggravating.</p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg, and other writers draw attention
to the effects of alcohol in hindering the liver
in its duty of destroying the toxic substances generated
within the system of a sick person by the
specific microbes to which the disease owes its
origin, saying that the activity of the liver in destroying
these poisons is one of the physiologic
processes which stand between the patient and
death.</p>

<p>The more this question is studied the more apparent
is it that, other things being equal, the sick
person who is cared for by a non-alcoholic physician
has a much better chance of recovery than the
one dosed by “a brandy doctor.”</p>


<h4>EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL UPON THE KIDNEYS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The kidneys, being the chief organs for the excretion of
nitrogen waste, are among the most important organs of the
body. Any defect in their healthy activity leads to serious interference
with the working of many organs, due to the accumulation
in the body of nitrogenous waste products. If both
kidneys be cut out of an animal, it dies in a few hours from
blood-poisoning, due to the accumulation of waste poisonous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>substances which the kidneys should have got rid of. Serious
kidney-disease amounts to pretty much the same thing as cutting
out the organs, since they are of little use if not healthy.
It is always fatal if not checked, and often kills in a short time.
The things which most frequently cause kidney disease are undue
exposure to cold, and indulgence in alcoholic drinks.”&mdash;Martin’s <i>Human Body</i>.</p>

<p>“The kidneys are supplied with arterial blood, which, having
given up water, urea, salt, and certain other substances, either
secreted or simply strained from it, returns to the kidneys
nearly as bright and fresh as when it entered them. While the
lungs are concerned in removing carbonic acid&mdash;the ashes of
the furnace&mdash;it is the peculiar province of the kidneys to remove
the products of the wear and tear of the bodily machinery&mdash;the
wasted nerve and muscle&mdash;in the form of urea, or other crystallizable
substances, the presence of which in the economy for
any considerable time is attended with disastrous results.</p>

<p>“Now, nature has put these organs, charged with so important
work, as far away as possible from any source of irritation.
Could alcohol get as direct access to them as to the liver, there
is no doubt that their function would be destroyed almost at
once, since the change in arterial blood by alcohol is much
more extensive and damaging than that wrought in such venous
blood as the liver receives from the portal veins. Thus while
the liver takes the alcohol immediately from the alimentary
canal, the kidneys receive it only after it has passed through
the liver, the heart, the lungs, and the heart again; by which
time much of it has escaped, while the remainder has been
greatly diluted by the blood of the general circulation; yet coming
to the kidneys even so considerably diluted, it has power to
congest, irritate, and excite them to the excretion of an unusual
amount of the watery elements of the urine, as if to wash the
irritant away.</p>

<p>“But it is only the watery element that is increased, not the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>urea, which is the substance representing the waste of vital
action, and is a poison to the system; this it is the special office of
the kidneys to remove. Not only does alcohol not increase
its elimination, but actually lessens the discharge. And should
the irritation of the spirit continue, or be augmented in force,
inflammation would follow, and the excretion of urea nearly or
entirely cease and life be in the greatest jeopardy. Relief or
death then must speedily follow.”&mdash;Dr. E. Chenery, of Boston,
in <i>Alcohol Inside Out</i>.</p>

<p>“Alcohol causes kidney-disease in several ways. In the first
place it unduly excites the activity of the organs. Next, by
impeding oxidation it interferes with the proper preparation of
nitrogen wastes: they are brought to the kidneys in an unfit
state for removal, and injure those organs. Third, when more
than a small quantity of alcohol is taken, some of it is passed
out of the body unchanged, through the kidneys, and injures
their substance. The kidney-disease most commonly produced
by alcohol is one kind of “Bright’s disease,” so called
from the physician who first described it. The connective
tissue of the organ grows in excess, and the true excreting
kidney-substance dwindles away. At last the organ becomes
quite unable to do its work, and death results.</p>

<p>“The three most common causes of Bright’s disease are an
acute illness, as scarlet fever, of which it is a frequent result;
sudden exposure to cold when warm (this often drives blood in
excessive quantity from the skin to internal organs, and leads
to kidney-disease); and the habitual drinking of alcoholic
liquids.”&mdash;Dr. Newell Martin in <i>The Human Body</i>.</p>

<p>“Every physician knows or should know, that the quantity
and quality of the effete, or waste, material separated from the
blood by the kidneys and voided in the urine, is such as to
render a knowledge of the action of any remedy or drink on
the function of these organs, of the greatest importance in the
treatment of all diseases, and especially those of an acute febrile
character. As was long since demonstrated by clinical obser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>vation,
and more recently by patient and accurate experiments
by Bouchard and others, the amount of toxic, or poisonous,
material naturally separated from the blood by the kidneys and
passed out in the urine is so great that if wholly retained by
failure of the kidneys to act for two or three days, speedy
death ensues. Equally familiar to every observing physician is
the fact that in all the acute febrile and inflammatory diseases,
not only is the quantity of the urine secreted generally diminished,
but its quality or constituency is also changed to a
greater degree than even its quantity. Thus, some of the more
important constituents are increased, others diminished, and
often new or foreign elements are found present, all resulting
from the disordered metabolic processes taking place throughout
the system during the progress of these diseases.</p>

<p>“It is, therefore, hardly necessary to remind the physician
that it is of the greatest importance to know as correctly as
possible both the direct and the indirect influence of every
medicine or drink on the action of the kidneys and all other
eliminating organs and structures, lest he unwittingly allow the
use of such as may not only retard the elimination of the specific
causes of disease, but also favor auto-intoxication by retarding
the elimination of the natural elements of excretion.</p>

<p>“That the presence of alcohol in the living system positively
lessens the reception and internal distribution of oxygen, and
consequently retards the oxidation processes of disassimilation
by which the various products for excretion are perfected and
their elimination facilitated, is so fully demonstrated, both by
observation and experiment, as no longer to admit of doubt.</p>

<p>“As nearly all the toxic elements of urine are the results of
these oxidation processes, the presence of alcohol in the system
could hardly fail to interfere with them in a notable degree.</p>

<p>“The direct and somewhat extensive series of experiments
instituted by Glazer, as published in the <i>Deut. Med. Wochensch.</i>,
Leipsic, Oct. 22, 1891, demonstrated this, as shown by
the following conclusions:&mdash;‘Alcohol, in even relatively moder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ate
quantities, irritates the kidneys, so that the exudation of leucocytes
and the formation of cylindrical casts may occur. It
also produces an unusual amount of uric acid crystals and oxalates,
due to the modified tissue changes produced by the alcohol.
The effect of a single act of over-indulgence in alcohol does not
last more than thirty-six hours, but it is cumulative under continued
use.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Chittenden kept several dogs under the influence of
alcohol eight or ten days, and found it to increase the amount
of uric acid in their urine more than 100 per cent. above the
normal proportion.</p>

<p>“Mohilansky, house-physician to Manassein’s clinic, in the
conclusions drawn from his interesting experiments on fifteen
young men to determine the effects of alcohol on the metabolic
processes generally, stated that ‘it does not possess any diuretic
action: but rather tends to inhibit the elimination of water
by the kidneys.’ It is further stated that this result is owing to
the coincident effect of diminished systemic oxidation and of
blood pressure.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, several observers have reported that the
flow of urine was increased by the use of alcohol. From as
full an examination of the subject as I have been able to make,
it appears that the diverse results obtained have depended upon
the previous habits of those experimented on, and the widely
varying quantities of water drank with the alcohol. When the
alcohol is taken with large quantities of water, as is usual with
those who use beer and fermented drinks generally, the total
amount of urine passed is usually increased, but not more than
is found to result from taking the same quantity of water without
any alcohol. When alcoholic drinks are taken by those
already habituated to its use, it has less marked effect on the
quantity and quality of the urine than when taken by those who
had previously been total abstainers. This was illustrated by
the experiments of Mohilansky on the fifteen men, some of whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>were habitual drinkers, some occasional drinkers, and others
total abstainers. When all were subjected to the same diet and
drinks, with alcohol, in two the daily amount of urine voided remained
unaltered, in five it was increased seven per cent., and in
eight it decreased twelve per cent. But whatever may be the variations
in the mere quantity of urine voided under the influence
of alcohol, the alterations in quality pretty uniformly show an
increase in the products of imperfect internal metamorphosis or
oxidation, such as uric acid, oxalates, casts, leucocytes, albumen
and potassium, with less of the normal products, as urea and
salts of sodium.</p>

<p>“During the past year I have met with three cases in which
the regular daily use of alcoholic drinks for several months, in
quantities not sufficient to produce intoxication, had so altered
the blood, and the renal function, that the urine contained both
casts and albumen, and some degree of œdema was observable
in the face and extremities. These changes were so marked as
to justify a diagnosis of incipient nephritis, or Bright’s disease.
Yet after totally abstaining from the use of alcoholic drinks
and remedies, and taking such vasomotor tonics as strychnine
and digitalis, with a regulated diet and fresh air, they completely
recovered.</p>

<p>“When it is remembered that in diphtheria, pneumonia and
typhoid fever, the acute diseases in which a large part of the
profession administer most freely alcoholic remedies, the function
of the kidney is altered in almost the same direction as are
found to take place under the influence of alcohol, it should
certainly cause every practitioner to pause and critically review
the pathological basis on which he has been prescribing. An
anæsthetic, like alcohol, may certainly render a patient with
diphtheria, pneumonia or typhoid fever more quiet, and cause
him to say he feels better, but if it at the same time diminishes
the internal distribution of oxygen, retards the oxidation and
elimination of waste and toxic products through the kidneys
and lungs, and lessens vasomotor force, it cannot fail to pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>tract
the duration of disease, and increase the ratio of mortality.”&mdash;Dr.
N. S. Davis, <i>A. M. T. A. Quarterly</i>, April, 1894.</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg, by a series of carefully executed
experiments, conclusively demonstrated that alcohol
hinders the elimination of poisonous matter by the
kidneys. This property of alcohol is one of the
objections which he sees to its use as a medicine.
He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Water applied externally stimulates elimination by the
pores of the skin, and employed freely internally by water
drinking, and enemas to be retained for absorption, aids liver
and kidney activity. If the patient dies it is because his liver
and kidneys have failed to destroy and eliminate the poisons
generated with sufficient rapidity to prevent their producing
fatal mischief in the body.”</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>ALCOHOL AS A MEDICINE.</h3>


<p>Although nearly all of the foremost scientific investigators
of the effects of alcohol upon the body
have lost faith in the old views of the usefulness of
alcoholic liquors as remedial agencies a considerable
proportion of the medical profession do not seem
yet to have learned how to treat disease without recourse
to the alcohol therapy. This is largely due to
the fact that the new thought has not yet crystallized
to any large extent in the medical text-books, and also
to the widely variant views held by professors of
medicine.</p>

<p>The medical use of alcohol has been, and still is,
the great bulwark of the liquor traffic. The user of
alcoholics as beverages always excuses himself, if
hard pressed by abstainers, upon the ground that
they must be of service or doctors would not recommend
them so frequently. In all prohibitory
amendment, and no-license campaigns, the cry of
“Useful as Medicine” has been the hardest for
temperance workers to meet, for they have felt
that they had to admit the statement as true, knowing
nothing to the contrary. Indeed, thousands of
those who advocate the prohibition of the sale of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>liquor as a beverage, use alcohol in some form quite
freely as medicine, and are as determined and
earnest in defence of their favorite “tipple” as any
old toper could well be. Many use it in the guise
of cordials, tonics, bitters, restoratives and the
thousand and one nostrums guaranteed to cure all
ills to which human flesh is heir.</p>

<p>The wide-spread belief in the necessity and
efficacy of alcoholics as remedies is the greatest
hindrance to the success of the temperance cause.
It is impossible to convince the mass of the people
that what is life-giving as medicine can be death-dealing
as beverage. The two stand, or fall,
together. Hence there is no more important question
before the medical profession, and the people
generally, than that of the action of alcohol in disease,
and, as a goodly number of the most distinguished
and successful physicians of Europe and
America declare it to be harmful rather than
helpful, it behooves thoughtful people to carefully
study the reasons they assign for holding
such an opinion. Certainly it is true that if physicians
and people would all adopt the views of the
advocates of non-alcoholic medication the temperance
problem would be solved, and the greatest
source of disease, crime, pauperism, insanity and
misery would be driven from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>To understand the arguments advanced in favor
of non-alcoholic medication it is needful to make
some study of the effects of alcohol upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>body, and of the purposes for which alcoholics are
prescribed medically.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol is used in sickness as a food, when solid
foods cannot be assimilated, “to support” or sustain,
the vitality; it is used as a stimulant, a tonic, a
sedative or narcotic, an anti-spasmodic, an antiseptic
and antipyretic; it is used in combination with
other drugs, in tinctures and in pharmacy.</i> It is
not wonderful that the people esteem it above all
other drugs, for none other is so variously and so
generally employed. Those who discard it as a
remedy teach that only in human delusions is it a
food or a stimulant, and for the other uses to
which it is put, outside of pharmacy, there are
different agents which may be more satisfactorily
employed.</p>


<h4>IS ALCOHOL FOOD?</h4>

<p>So well agreed are all the scientific investigators
that alcohol has no appreciable food value that it
would seem foolish to spend time upon a discussion
of alcohol as food were it not that the idea of its
“supporting the vitality” in disease, in some
mysterious way is deeply rooted in the professional,
as well as the popular mind.</p>

<p><i>Foods are substances which, when taken into the
body, undergo change by the process of digestion;
they give strength and heat and force; they build
up the tissues of the body, and make blood; and
they induce healthy, normal action of all the bodily
functions.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Alcohol does none of these. It undergoes no
change in the stomach, but is rapidly absorbed and
mixed with the blood, and has been discovered
hours after its ingestion in the brain, blood and
tissues, unchanged alcohol. In many of the experiments
made with it upon animals, considerable
quantities of the amount swallowed were recovered
from the excretions of the body, without any
change having taken place in its composition.
This, of itself, is sufficient evidence to show that it
is a substance which the body does not recognize
as a food.</p>

<p><i>Foods build up the tissues of the body.</i> All physiologists
are agreed that since alcohol contains no
nitrogen it cannot be a tissue-forming food; there
is no difference of opinion here. Dr. Lionel Beale,
the eminent physiologist, says that alcohol is not a
food and does not nourish the tissues.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is nothing in alcohol with which any part of the body
can be nourished.”&mdash;Cameron’s <i>Manual of Hygiene</i>.</p>

<p>“Alcohol contains no nitrogen; it has none of the qualities
of the structure-building foods; it is incapable of being transformed
into any of them; it does not supply caseine, albumen,
fibrine or any other of those substances which go to build up
the muscles, nerves and other active organs.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir B. W.
Richardson.</span></p>

<p>“It is not demonstrable that alcohol undergoes conversion
into tissue.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. W. A. Hammond.</span></p></div>

<p>If it is a food why do all writers and experimenters
exclude it from the diet of children, and why is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>the caution always given people to not take it upon
an empty stomach? Foods are supposed to be
particularly suited to an empty stomach.</p>

<p><i>Foods induce healthy, normal action of all the bodily
functions.</i></p>

<p>The chapter upon “Diseases Produced by Alcohol”
is evidence that by this test alcohol shows
up in its true nature as a poison, and not a food.
Alcohol destroys healthy normal action of all the
bodily functions, and builds up impure fat, fatty
degeneration, instead of strong, firm muscle. Dr.
Parkes, one of the most famous of English students
of alcohol, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These alcoholic degenerations are certainly not confined to
the notoriously intemperate. I have seen them in women accustomed
to take wine in quantities not excessive, and who
would have been shocked at the imputation that they were
taking too much, although the result proved that for them it
was excess.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ezra M. Hunt, late secretary of New Jersey
State Board of Health, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The question of excess occurs in sickness as well as in
health, and all the more because its determination is so difficult
and the evil effects so indisputable. The dividing line in medicine,
even between use and abuse, is so zigzag and invisible that
common mortals, in groping for it, generally stumble beyond it,
and the delicate perception of medical art too often fails in the
recognition.”</p></div>

<p>All non-alcoholic writers assert that the continuous
use of alcohol as a medicine is equally injurious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>to all the bodily functions as the employment of it
as a beverage. Calling it medicine does not change
its deadly nature, nor does the medical attendant
possess any magical power by which a destructive
poison may be converted into a restorative agent.</p>

<p>Dr. Noble, writing recently to the <i>London Times</i>,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The internal use of alcohol in disease is as injurious as in
health.”</p></div>

<p>Since foods induce healthy, normal action of all
the bodily functions, and alcohol injures every organ
of the body in direct proportion to the amount consumed,
by this test it is proved to not be a food.</p>

<p><i>Foods give strength.</i> Alcohol weakens the body.
This has been determined again and again by experiments
upon gangs of workmen and regiments
of soldiers. These experiments always resulted in
showing that upon the days when the men were
supplied with liquor they could neither use their
muscles so powerfully, nor for so long a time, as on
the days when they received no alcoholic drink.
Of the results of such tests Sir Andrew Clark, late
Physician to Queen Victoria, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is capable of proof beyond all possibility of question that
alcohol not only does not help work but is a serious hinderer
of work.”</p></div>

<p>So satisfied are generals in the British army of
the weakening effect of alcohol that its use is now
forbidden to soldiers when any considerable call is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>to be made upon their strength. The latest example
of this was in the recent Soudan campaign
under Sir Herbert Kitchener. An order was issued
by the War Department that not a drop of intoxicating
liquor was to be allowed in camp save for
hospital use. The army made phenomenal forced
marches through the desert, under a burning sun
and in a climate famous for its power to kill the
unacclimated. It is said that never before was
there a British campaign occasioning so little sickness
and showing so much endurance. Some
Greek merchants ran a large consignment of liquors
through by the Berber-Suakim route, but Sir Herbert
had them emptied upon the sand of the desert.
A reporter telegraphed to England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The men are in magnificent condition and in great spirits.
They are as hard as nails, and in a recent desert march of
fifteen miles, with manœuvring instead of halts, the whole lasting
for five continuous hours, not a single man fell out!”</p></div>

<p>This was in decided contrast to the march in the
African war some years before when, as they passed
through a malarial district, and a dram was served,
men fell out by dozens. Dr. Parkes, one of the
medical officers, prevailed upon the commander-in-chief
to not allow any more alcoholic drams while
the troops were marching to Kumassi.</p>

<p>Experiments in lifting weights have also been
tried upon men by careful investigators. In every
case it was found that even beer, and very dilute
solutions of alcohol, would diminish the height to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>which the lifted weight could be raised. As an illustration
of the deceptive power of alcohol upon
people under its influence, it is said that persons
experimented upon were under the impression, after
the drink, that they could do more work, and do it
more easily, although the testing-machine showed
exactly the contrary to be true.</p>

<p>Athletes and their trainers have learned by experience
that alcohol does not give strength, but is,
in reality, a destroyer of muscular power. No careful
trainer will allow a candidate for athletic honors
to drink even beer, not to speak of stronger liquors.
When Sullivan, the once famous pugilist, was defeated
by Corbett, he said in lamenting his lost
championship, “It was the <i>booze</i> did it”; meaning
that he had violated training rules, and used liquor.
University teams and crews have proved substantially
that drinking men are absolutely no good in
sports, or upon the water. Football and baseball
teams, anxious to excel, are beginning to have a
cast-iron temperance pledge for their members. So
practical experience of those competing in tests of
strength and endurance teach eloquently that
alcohol does not give strength, but rather weakens
the body, by rendering the muscles flabby.</p>

<p>Sandow, the modern Samson, wrote his methods
of training in one of the magazines a few years ago,
and stated that he used no alcoholic beverages.
The ancient Samson was not allowed to taste even
wine from birth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>A question worthy of serious consideration is:
how are the sick to be strengthened and “supported”
by drinks which athletes are warned to
specially shun as weakening to the body? Either
the sick are mistakenly advised, or the athletes are
in error. Which seems the more likely?</p>

<p>Dr. Richardson says in <i>Lectures on Alcohol</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I would earnestly impress that the systematic administration
of alcohol for the purpose of giving and sustaining strength is
an entire delusion.”</p></div>

<p>In another place he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Never let this be forgotten in thinking of strong drink: that
the drink is strong only to destroy; that it never by any possibility
adds strength to those who drink it.”</p></div>

<p>Sir William Gull, late physician to the Prince of
Wales, said before a Select Committee of the House
of Lords on Intemperance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is a great feeling in society that strong wine and
other strong drinks give strength. A large number of people
have fallen into that error, and fall into it every day.”</p></div>

<p>Any unprejudiced person can readily see that experience
and experiment unite in testifying that
alcohol does not give strength, hence differs radically
from most substances commonly classed as
foods. Yet millions of dollars are spent annually
by deluded people upon supposedly strength-giving
drinks, and thousands of the sick are ignorantly, or
carelessly, advised to take beer or wine to make
them strong and to <i>support</i> them when solid food
cannot be assimilated. Truly, “My people is destroyed
for lack of knowledge.”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Foods give force to the body.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Richardson says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We learn in respect to alcohol that the temporary excitement
is produced at the expense of the animal matter and
animal force, and that the ideas of the necessity of resorting
to it as a food, to build up the body or to lift up the forces of
the body, are ideas as solemnly false as they are widely disseminated.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Brodie says in <i>Physiological Inquiries</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Stimulants do not create nerve power: they merely enable
you, as it were, to use up that which is left.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. E. Smith:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is no evidence that it increases nervous influence,
while there is much evidence that it lessens nervous power.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Wm. Hargreaves, of Philadelphia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is sometimes said by the advocates and defenders of
alcohol, that by its use force is generated more abundantly.
This it certainly cannot do, as it does not furnish anything to
feed the blood or to store up nourishment to replenish the
expenditure. For by their own theory, the increase of action
must cause an increase of wear and tear; hence alcohol
instead of sustaining life or vitality, must cause a direct waste
or expenditure of <i>vital force</i>.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Auguste Forel, of Switzerland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“All alcoholic liquors are poisons, and especially brain-poisons,
and their use shortens life. They cannot therefore be
regarded as sources of nourishment or force. They should be
resisted as much as opium, morphia, cocaine, hashish and
the like.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. W. F. Pechuman, of Detroit, in his valuable
little treatise, <i>Alcohol&mdash;Is it a Medicine?</i> says
clearly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When alcohol or any other irritant poison is put into the
system, the conservative vital force, recognizing it as an enemy,
at once makes an effort through the living matter to rid the
system of the offender;&mdash;the heart increases in action and new
strength seems to appear. Now, right here is where the great
mass of people and a large number of physicians are deluded.
They mistake the extra effort of the vital force to preserve the
body against harmful agencies for an actual increase in
strength as the result of the agent given; we wonder that they
can be so blind as not to see the reaction which invariably
occurs soon after the administration of their so-called stimulant.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. F. R. Lees, of England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“All poisons lessen vitality and deteriorate the ultimate
tissue in which force is reposited. Alcohol is an agent, the
sole, perpetual and inevitable effects of which are to avert
blood development, to retain waste matter, to irritate mucous
and other tissues, to thicken normal juices, to impede digestion,
to deaden nervous sensibility, to lower animal heat, to
kill molecular life, <i>and to waste, through the excitement it
creates in heart and head, the grand controlling forces of the
nerves and brain</i>.”</p></div>

<p>If alcohol is a destroyer of bodily force, as any
ordinary observer of drinking men can readily see,
it is a problem beyond solving, how it is going to
give force to, or sustain vitality in, the patient
hovering between life and death. Too often has it
been the means of hastening into eternity those
who, but for its mistaken use, might have recovered
from the illness affecting <a name="Page_106t" id="Page_106t"></a><a href="#Page_106tn">them</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Food gives heat to the body.</i></p>

<p>Alcohol does not, but really robs the body of its
natural warmth. This finding of science was received
with the utmost incredulity when first
presented to the medical world, but the invention
of the clinical thermometer settled it beyond controversy.
It is now believed by all but a very few
of those who have knowledge of the physiological
effects of alcohol. While Dr. N. S. Davis, of
Chicago, was the first to demonstrate this fact, it
was Dr. B. W. Richardson, of England, who succeeded
in putting it prominently before the attention
of physicians.</p>

<p>The normal temperature of the human body is a
little over 98 degrees by Fahrenheit’s thermometer.
If the temperature is found to be much above or
below 98 degrees the person is considered out of
health; indeed by this condition alone physicians
are able to detect serious forms of disease. By the
use of the clinical thermometer, placed under the
tongue, it is easy to determine what agents acting
upon the body will cause the temperature to vary
from the natural standard. When alcohol is swallowed
there is at first a decided feeling of warmth
induced; if the temperature be taken now it will
be found that in a person unaccustomed to alcohol
the warmth may be raised half a degree; in one
accustomed to alcohol the warmth may be raised
a full degree, or even a degree and a half beyond
the natural standard. But this warmth is only
temporary, and is soon succeeded by chilliness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Richardson says in his <i>Temperance Lesson
Book</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The sense of warmth occurs in the following way: When
the alcohol enters the body, and by the blood-vessels is conveyed
to all parts of the body, it reduces the nervous power of the
small blood-vessels which are spread out through the whole of
the surface of the skin. In their weakened state these vessels
are unable duly to resist the course of blood which is coming
into them from the heart under its stroke. The result is that
an excess of warm blood fresh from the heart is thrown into
these fine vessels, which causes the skin to become flushed and
red as it is seen to be after wine or other strong drink has
been swallowed and sent through the body. So, as there is
now more warm blood in the skin than is natural to it, a sense
of increased warmth is felt. The skin of the body is the most
sensitive of substances and the sense of warmth through, or
over the whole surface of the skin is conveyed from it to the
brain and nervous centres of the body, by which we are enabled
to feel.</p>

<p>“The warmth of surface which seems to be imparted by
alcohol, only <i>seems</i> to be imparted. Positively the warmth is
not imparted by the alcohol, but is set free by it.</p>

<p>“In a short time the sense of warmth is succeeded by a feeling
of slight chilliness. Unless the person is in a very warm
room, or has recently partaken of food, the thermometer will
now show a decided decrease in temperature, reaching often to
a degree. Should the person go out into a cold air, and
especially should he go into a cold air while badly supplied with
food, the fall of temperature may reach to two degrees below the
natural standard of bodily heat. In this state he easily takes
cold, and in frosty weather readily contracts congestion of the
lungs, and that disease which is known as bronchitis. If the
person drinks to drunkenness his temperature will be found to
be from two and a half to three degrees below the natural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>standard. It takes from two to three days, under the most
favorable circumstances, for the animal warmth to become
steadily re-established after a drunken spree.</p>

<p>“The excitement of the mind in the early stages of drunkenness
is not natural; it is exhaustive of the bodily powers, and
exhaustive for no useful purpose whatever. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“As nothing has been supplied by the alcohol to keep up the
supply of heat the vital energy is rapidly exhausted, and if the
person is exposed to cold, the exhaustion becomes extreme,
sometimes fatal. All great consumers of alcohol are chillier
during winter than are abstainers, and as they labor under the
delusion that they must take wine or ale or spirits to keep
them warm, they keep on making matters worse by constantly
resorting to their enemy for relief.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Newell Martin makes this very clear in his
physiology, <i>The Human Body</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Our feeling of being warm depends on the nerves of the
skin. We have no nerves which tell us whether heart or
muscles or brain, are warmer or cooler. These inside parts
are always hotter than the skin, and if blood which has been
made hot in them flows in large quantity to the skin, we feel
warmer because the skin is heated. As alcoholic drinks make
more blood flow through the skin, they often make a man feel
warmer. But their actual effect upon the temperature of the
whole body is to lower it. The more blood that flows through
the skin, the more heat is given off from the body to the air,
and the more blood, so cooled, is sent back to the internal
organs. The consequence is that alcohol, in proportion to the
amount taken, cools the body as a whole, though it may for a
time heat the skin.”</p></div>

<p>If other evidence that alcohol is not heat-producing
in the body were necessary it could be found in
the fact that the products of combustion are de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>creased
when it is present in the body. The
quantity of carbonic acid exhaled by the breath is
proportionately diminished with the decline of
animal heat.</p>

<p>Arctic explorers learned by experience what
science discovered by experiment. Dr. Hayes, the
explorer, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“While fresh animal food, and especially fat, is absolutely
essential to the inhabitants and travelers in Arctic countries,
alcohol, in almost any shape, is not only completely useless, but
positively injurious.”</p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Johnson, who accompanied Nansen
upon his northern expedition, said, when interviewed
by a reporter of the London <i>Daily News</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The common opinion that alcohol becomes in some way a
necessity in cold countries is entirely a mistaken one. This
has been conclusively proved by the expedition. In making up
his list of the <i>Fram’s</i> equipments, Nansen did not include
any spirits, with the exception of some spirits of wine for lamps
and stoves.”</p></div>

<p>In the list of stores taken upon the long sledging
expedition after leaving the <i>Fram</i> no liquors are
mentioned. See <i>Farthest North</i>, by Nansen. The
omission of spirits was not because of any “temperance
fanaticism,” but because the experience of
former Arctic expeditions had shown clearly that
men freeze more readily after partaking of alcohol
than when they totally abstain from it.</p>

<p>That wine is not a fuel-food was shown conclusively
in the Franco-Prussian war during the siege
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>of Paris. Food was scarce in the French Army,
and wine was liberally supplied. The men complained
bitterly of the extreme chilliness which
affected them. Dr. Klein, a French staff surgeon,
was reported in the <i>Medical Temperance Journal</i> of
England, October 1873, as saying of this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We found most decidedly that alcohol was no substitute for
bread and meat. We also found that it was no substitute for
coals. We of the army had to sleep outside Paris on the frozen
ground. We had plenty of alcohol, but it did not make us
warm. Let me tell you there is nothing that will make you
feel the cold more, nothing which will make you feel the dreadful
sense of hunger more, than alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>There is no evidence against alcohol stronger
than that which shows it to be not heat-producing,
as commonly believed, but a reducer of heat in the
body. Indeed, this question of bodily temperature
is used in recent times to decide whether a man
who has fallen upon the street is troubled by apoplexy,
or influenced by alcoholism. If the clinical
<a name="Page_111t" id="Page_111t"></a><a href="#Page_111tn">thermometer</a> shows the temperature to be above
normal, it is apoplexy; if below normal, it is alcoholism.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol is clearly proved to be not a fuel-food, for if it were
it would enable the body to resist cold, instead of making it
colder; and in the extreme degrees of cold it would go on
burning like other fuel-foods, and would maintain, instead of
helping to destroy, life.”&mdash;Richardson’s <i>Lesson Book</i>.</p></div>

<p>Yet because it creates a glow of warmth in the
skin immediately after drinking it, thousands of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>people will discredit all evidence that it is a reducer
of bodily heat. Clinical thermometers, and after-sensations
of chilliness, are unheeded, for “Wine is
a mocker,” and multitudes are willing to be deceived
by it.</p>

<p>So, also, with the conclusions against it as a
strengthening agent; because it dulls the sense of
hunger and of fatigue, those who crave it will declare
in the face of all scientific testimony that it
strengthens them, and takes the place of food.
They will cite, too, the cases of people who “lived
upon whisky” during an illness of greater or less
duration. Of the sustaining of life upon alcohol
only, Dr. N. S. Davis has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The falsity of all such stories is made apparent by the fact
that nineteen-twentieths of all the alcoholic drinks given to the
sick are given in connection with sugar, milk, eggs or meat-broths,
which furnish the nutriment, and would support the
patients better if given with the same perseverance without the
alcohol than with it. While we have quite a number of examples
of men living on nothing but water forty or fifty days, I
have never seen or learned of a well-authenticated case of a
man’s taking or receiving into his system nothing but alcohol
for half of that length of time, without becoming sick with either
gastro-duodenitis, nephritis, or delirium tremens.”</p></div>

<p><i>Some of the defenders of the medicinal use of
alcohol claim that since it has been shown to reduce
tissue waste it should be classed as an indirect food, a
conserver of tissue.</i> Of this claim, Dr. N. S. Davis
says in the <i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i>, November,
1895:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A careful study of the conditions and processes necessary
for both tissue building or nutrition, and tissue waste or disintegration,
in all the higher order of animals, will show that
neither process can be materially retarded without retarding or
preventing the other. Both processes take place only in bioplasm
or vitalized matter, supplied with oxygen, water and heat.
Neither the assimilation of new material food, nor its use in
tissue building can be effected without the presence of free
oxygen and nuclein, or corpuscular elements of the blood.
And without the presence of the same elements we can have
no natural tissue disintegration and removal of the waste.
The processes of tissue building and tissue disintegration, are
therefore, so intimately related, and dependent upon the same
materials and forces, that neither can be hastened or retarded
from day to day without influencing the other. When alcohol
or any other substance, introduced into the blood, retards the
tissue waste, as shown by the diminished amount of excretory
products, it must do so by either diminishing the amount of
free oxygen in the blood, by impairing the vasomotor and
trophic nerve functions or by direct impairment of the properties
of the nuclein or protogen elements of the blood and
tissues. The popular idea, both in and out of the profession is,
that the alcohol, by further oxidation in the blood, lessens the
amount of oxygen to act on the tissues, and generates heat or
’some kind of force.’ Those who advocate this theory of saving
the tissues by combining the oxygen with alcohol seem to forget
that in doing so they are diverting and using up the only
agent, oxygen, capable of combining with, and promoting the
elimination of, all natural waste products as well as the
various toxic elements causing disease.</p>

<p>“But the theory that alcohol directly combines with the
oxygen of the blood by which it would be converted into carbonic
acid and water with evolution of heat is completely
refuted by the well-known fact that its presence in the blood
diminishes both temperature and elimination of carbonic acid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>as already stated. Physiologists of the present day very generally
agree that the capacity of the blood to receive oxygen from
the lungs, and convey it to the systemic capillaries and various
tissues, depends chiefly on its hemoglobin (red coloring matter),
protein, or albuminous and saline elements.</p>

<p>“Both experimental and clinical facts in abundance show
that alcohol at all ordinary temperatures displays a much
stronger affinity for these elements of the blood and tissues,
than it does for oxygen. And when present in the blood, it
rapidly attracts both water and hemoglobin from the corpuscular
and albuminoid elements of that fluid, and thereby
diminishes its reception and distribution of oxygen. We are
thus enabled to see clearly how the alcohol diminishes the
oxygenation and decarbonization of the blood, and retards all
tissue changes both of nutrition and waste without itself undergoing
oxidation with evolution of heat. Consequently, instead
of acting as a shield or conservator of the tissues by simply
combining with the oxygen, the alcohol directly impairs the
properties and functions of the most highly vitalized elements
of the blood itself, and thereby not only retards tissue waste
but also equally retards the highest grades of nutrition, and
favors only sclerotic, fatty and molecular degenerations, as we
see everywhere resulting from its continued use. Can an agent
displaying such properties and effects be called a <i>food</i>, either
direct or indirect, without a total disregard for the proper
meaning of words?”</p></div>

<p>In another place he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“This lessening of the elimination of tissue waste is simply
an evidence of the accumulation of poisonous substances within
the body, through the lessened activity of liver and kidneys
and the impairment of the blood.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ezra M. Hunt says in <i>Alcohol as Food and as
Medicine</i>, page 37:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It sounds conservative of health to say of a substance that
it delays the breaking down of tissue, but the physiologist does
not allow a substance which occasions such delay, to possess,
because of that, either dietetic or remedial value. To increase
weight by prolonged constipation is not a physiological process.”</p></div>

<p>Dalton says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The importance of tissue change to the maintenance of life
is readily shown by the injurious effects which follow upon its
disturbance. If the discharge of the excrementitious substances
be in any way impeded or suspended, these substances accumulate
either in the blood or tissues, or both. In consequence
of this retention and accumulation they become
poisonous, and rapidly produce a derangement of the vital
functions. Their influence is principally exerted upon the
nervous system, through which they produce most frequent
irritability, disturbance of the special senses, delirium, insensibility,
coma, and finally, death.”</p></div>

<p>The power to retard the passage of waste matter
from the system is one of the gravest objections to
the use of alcohol in sickness, as the germs of disease
are thereby caused to remain longer in the
body than they would, were no alcohol or drug of
similar action, used. Thus recovery is delayed, if
not effectually hindered.</p>

<p>The preponderance of scientific evidence is all
against alcohol as possessing food qualities. It
contains no elements capable of entering into the
composition of any part of the body, hence cannot
give strength; it is not a fuel-food as it does not
supply heat to the body, but decreases temperature;
and its classification as indirect food because it re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>tards
the passage of waste matter is shown to be
utterly unscientific, as any agent which interferes
with the natural processes of assimilation and disintegration
is a dangerous agent, a poison rather
than a food.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises:&mdash;</p>

<p>If these drinks are not liquid food, as we have
been taught to believe, how is it, since they are
made from food, as barley, corn, grapes, potatoes,
etc?</p>

<p>These drinks are not food, although made from
food, because in the process of manufacturing them
the food principle is destroyed. The grain is
malted to change starch into sugar&mdash;loss of food
principle begins here&mdash;then the malted grain is
soaked in water to extract the saccharine matter.
When the sugar is all in the water the grain goes to
feed cattle or hogs, and the sweetened water is
fermented. The fermentation changes the sugar
into alcohol.</p>

<p>Analyses of beer by eminent chemists show an
average of 90 per cent. water, 4 per cent. alcohol,
and 6 per cent. malt extract. The malt extract
consists of gum, sugar, various acids, salts and hop
extract. Starch and sugar are all of these capable of
digestion, and the amount of them would be equal
to 39 ounces to the barrel of beer. Liebig, the
great German chemist, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If a man drinks daily 8 or 10 quarts of the best Bavarian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>beer, in a year he will have taken into his system the nutritive
constituents contained in a 5 pound loaf of bread.”</p></div>

<p>Eight quarts a day for a year would be 2,920
quarts, or a little more than 23 barrels. If sold to
the consumer at the low rate of five cents a pint, it
would cost him $292; a high price for as much nourishment
as in a 5 pound loaf!</p>

<p>Analyses of wine by reliable chemists show that
the consumer must pay $500 for the equivalent in
nourishment of a 5 pound loaf of bread, wine being
higher priced than beer. Wines average 80 per cent.
water, about 15 per cent. alcohol, and 5 per cent.
residue. This residue is composed of sugar, tartaric,
acetic and carbonic acids, salts of potassium
and sodium, tannic acid, and traces of an ethereal
substance which gives the peculiar or distinguishing
flavor. The only one of these ingredients possessing
food value is sugar; this exists chiefly in what
are called sweet wines. Yet how many thousands
of people spend money they can ill afford for wines
and beers to build up the failing strength of some
loved one! A costly delusion, and too often a
fatal one!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Distilled liquors, if unadulterated, contain literally nothing
but water and alcohol, except traces of juniper in gin, and the
flavor of the fermented material from which they have been distilled.”&mdash;<i>Influence
of Alcohol</i>, by N. S. Davis, M. D.</p></div>

<p>It is the solemn duty of those to whom the people
look for instruction in matters of health to undeceive
the toiling masses as to the food-value of alco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>holic
liquids. Some of the medical profession are
faithful in this regard, but too many others are
themselves deceived, or care not for the destruction
of the people.</p>


<h4>IS ALCOHOL A STIMULANT?</h4>

<p>A lady asked her family physician several years
ago what he thought of the views of those medical
writers who class alcohol as a narcotic, and not a
stimulant. He answered with some heat, “Any
one who says alcohol is not a stimulant is either a
fool or a knave!” He could not have been aware
that some of the most distinguished professors in
American medical colleges teach that alcohol is
not, properly speaking, a stimulant, but a narcotic.</p>

<p>The accepted definition of a stimulant in medical
literature is some agent capable of exciting or increasing
<i>vital activity</i> as a whole, or the natural
activity of some one structure or organ.</p>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis has said repeatedly that both
clinical and experimental observations show that
alcohol directly diminishes the functional activity
of all nerve structures, pre-eminently those of respiration
and circulation, thus decreasing the internal
distribution of oxygen, which is nature’s own
special exciter of all vital action.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Consequently it is antagonistic to all true stimulants or
remedies capable of increasing vital activity. Instead, therefore,
of meriting the name of <i>stimulant</i>, alcohol should be designated
and used only as an anæsthetic and sedative, or depressor of
vital activity.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is taken from an editorial article
in the <i>American Medical Temperance Quarterly</i> for
January, 1894:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Drs. Sidney Ringer and H. Sainsbury in a carefully executed
series of experiments on the isolated heart of the frog,
found that all the alcohol when mixed with the blood circulating
through the heart, uniformly diminished the action of that
organ in direct proportion to the quantity of alcohol used, until
complete paralysis was induced. In closing their report in regard
to the action of different alcohols, they say that ‘by their
direct action on the cardiac tissue these drugs are clearly
<i>paralyzant</i>, and that this appears to be the case from the outset,
<i>no stage of increased force of contraction preceding</i>.’</p>

<p>“Professor Martin, while in connection with the Johns Hopkins
University, performed an equally careful series of experiments
in regard to the action of ethylic, or ordinary alcohol,
directly on the cardiac structures of the dog, and with the same
results. He makes the following explicit statement of the
results obtained by him. ‘Blood containing one-fourth per
cent. by volume, that is two and a half parts per 1000 of absolute
alcohol, almost invariably diminishes, within a minute, the
work done by the heart; blood containing one-half per cent.
always diminishes it, and may even bring the amount pumped
out by the left ventricle to so small a quantity that it is not sufficient
to supply the coronary arteries.’</p>

<p>“In 1883, R. Dubois, by direct experimenting upon animals,
found that the presence of alcohol in the blood much intensified
the action of chloroform and thereby rendered a much less
dose fatal.</p>

<p>“Prof. H. C. Wood of the University of Pennsylvania, in an
address upon Anæsthesia to the Tenth International Medical
Congress, of Berlin, in 1890, said: ‘In my own experiments with
alcohol, an eighty per cent. fluid was used largely diluted with
water. The amount injected into the jugular vein varied in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>different experiments from 5 to 20 c. c.; and in no case have I
been able to detect any increase in the size of the pulse or in the
arterial pressure produced by alcohol, when the heart was failing
during advanced chloroform anæsthesia. On the other hand,
on several occasions, the larger amounts of alcohol apparently
greatly increased the rapidity of the fall of arterial pressure,
and aided materially in extinguishing the pulse.</p>

<p>“Sir Henry Thompson says: ‘That alcohol is an anæsthetic
and paralyzant is a fact too well established to be questioned
or contradicted.’</p>

<p>“Dr. J. J. Ridge, of London, has published elaborate tables,
showing that even small doses of alcohol, averaging one tablespoonful
of spirits&mdash;not quite half a wineglass of claret or
champagne, and not quite a quarter of a pint of ale&mdash;impair
vision, feeling, and sensibility to weight, without the subject’s
being conscious of any alteration. Dr. Scougal, of New York,
has repeated and confirmed these experiments, and also demonstrated
that the hearing was similarly affected.</p>

<p>“Drs. Nichol and Mossop, of Edinburgh, conducted a series
of experiments on each other, examining the eye by means of
the ophthalmoscope while the system was under the influence of
various drugs. They found that the nerves controlling the
delicate blood-vessels of the retina were paralyzed by a dose of
about a tablespoonful of brandy.</p>

<p>“Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Hartford, Conn., has deduced some
valuable facts from his experiments with the sphygmograph,
upon the action of the heart. He has found by repeated experiments
that while alcohol apparently increases the force and
volume of the heart’s action, the irregular tracings of the sphygmograph
show that the real vital force is diminished, and
hence its apparent stimulating power is deceptive.”&mdash;Extract
from the Annual Address before the Medical Temperance
Association at San Francisco, Cal., June 8, 1894, by Dr. I. N.
Quimby, of Jersey City, N. J.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg, of Battle Creek, Mich., has
made extensive experiments as to the effects of
alcohol. In summing up the results of these he
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It would seem that no further evidence could be required
that alcohol is a narcotic and an anæsthetic, rather than a
stimulant, and that its use as a supporting and tonic remedy is a
practice without foundation in either scientific theory or natural
clinical experience.”</p></div>

<p>Sir B. W. Richardson at a medical breakfast in
London in 1895, stated that though alcohol produced
an increase in the motion of the heart it was ultimately
weaker in its action, so he resolved to give
up using such an agent.</p>

<p>Dr. A. B. Palmer of the University of Michigan
prepared a “Report” upon alcohol in 1885 for the
Michigan State Medical Society in which he cited
experiments showing that the opinion that alcohol
stimulates the heart by an increase of real force, is
an error. It creates a flutter, but decreases power.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Increased frequency of pulsation is often the strongest evidence
of diminished power&mdash;as the fluttering pulse of extreme
weakness.”</p></div>

<p>He classes alcohol with chloroform.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If chloroform is a narcotic, alcohol is a narcotic. If chloroform
is an anæsthetic, alcohol is an anæsthetic. If one is
essentially a depressing agent, so is the other. Their strong
resemblance no one can question. The chief difference is that
the alcoholic narcosis is longer continued, and its secondary
effects are more severe.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>In closing his summary of the changes in scientific
knowledge of this drug he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We said it was a direct heart exciter. We now know it is
a direct heart depressor. We said, and nearly all the text-books
still say, it is a direct cardiac stimulant. We know from most
conclusive experiments it is a direct <i>cardiac paralyzant</i>.”</p></div>

<p>The following is taken from one of the many excellent
papers upon alcohol written by that Nestor
among physicians, Dr. N. S. Davis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcoholics are very generally prescribed in that weakness of
the heart sometimes met with in low forms of fever and in the
advanced stage of other acute diseases. It is claimed that
these agents are capable of strengthening and sustaining the
action of the heart under the circumstances just named, and
also under the first depressing influence of severe shock.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the ascertained physiological action of
alcohol on the human system, as developed by a wide range of
experimental investigation, to sustain this claim. I have used
the sphygmograph and every other available means for testing
experimentally the effects of alcohol upon the action of the
heart and blood-vessels generally, but have failed in every instance
to get proof of any increased force of cardiac action.</p>

<p>“The first and very transient effect is generally increased
frequency of beat, followed immediately by dilatation of the
peripheral vessels from impaired vasomotor sensibility, and
the same unsteady or wavy sphygmographic tracing as is given
in typhoid fever, and which is usually regarded as evidence of
cardiac debility. Turning from the field of experimentation to
the sick-room, my search for evidences of the power of alcohol
to sustain the force of the heart, or in any way to strengthen
the patient has been equally unsuccessful. I was educated
and entered upon the practice of medicine at a time when
alcoholic drinks were universally regarded as stimulating and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>beat-producing, and commenced their use without prejudice or
preconceived notions. But the first ten years of direct clinical
or practical observation satisfied me fully of the incorrectness
of those views, and very nearly banished the use of these
agents from my list of remedies. While it is true that during
the last thirty years I have not prescribed for internal use the
aggregate amount of one quart of any kind of fermented or
distilled drinks, either in private or hospital practice, yet I have
continued to have abundant opportunity for observing the
effects of these agents as given by others with whom I have
been in council; and simple truth compels me to say that I
have never yet seen a case in which the use of alcoholic drinks
either increased the force of the heart’s action or strengthened
the patient beyond the first thirty minutes after it was swallowed. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Nothing is easier than self-deception in this matter. A
patient is suddenly taken with syncope, or nervous weakness,
from which abundant experience has shown that a speedy
recovery would take place by simple rest and fresh air. But in
the alarm of patient and friends something must be done. A
little wine or brandy is given, and, as it is not sufficient to
positively prevent, the patient in due time revives just as would
have been the case if neither wine nor brandy had been used.”</p></div>

<p>In the <i>Medical Pioneer</i> of November, 1895, Prof.
E. MacDowel Cosgrave, Professor of Biology,
Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The result of all recent investigation is to show that the
use of alcohol when a stimulant effect is desired, is an error;
and that, from first to last alcohol acts as a narcotic.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Edmunds, of London, said in an address
given in Manchester:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“By giving alcohol as a stimulant in exhausting diseases, I
believe we always do as we should in giving a dose of opium
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>and brandy and water to comfort a half suffocated patient;
i. e., increase his danger. If that be so, we reduce alcohol not
only from the position of food medicine, but we reduce it from
the position of a goad; and we say that the supposititious stimulating
or goading influence of alcohol is a mere delusion; that
in fact alcohol always lessens the power of the patients, and
always damages their chance of recovery, when it is a question
of their getting through exhausting diseases.”</p></div>

<p>Many more such quotations might be adduced.
Enough are given to show that the popular use of
alcohol, when a stimulant is required, is considered
a grave error by those who have most thoroughly
studied the effects of this drug.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOL AS A TONIC.</h4>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge, of London, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The action of alcohol in relaxing unstriped muscular fibre,
which entitles it to be called an anti-spasmodic, robs it of all
claim to give tone. The sense of exhilaration which follows
small doses of alcohol has been mistaken for real strength and
increase of vitality. It is well known that relaxation of the
blood-vessels throughout the body is one of the first effects of
alcohol. The arteries of the retina have been observed to
dilate after very small doses of alcohol. The diminution of
tone is well seen in the tracings of the pulse under the influence
of alcohol. If one needs a tonic, therefore, alcohol is one
of the things to be shunned altogether.</p>

<p>“But alcoholic beverages contain other things beside alcohol.
Beer contains infusion of hops, or other bitter stomachics.
Some wines contain tannin. These ingredients, by creating or
stimulating the appetite, increase the strength and vital power
in certain cases. But we have a large number of drugs which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>will do the same without the disadvantages arising from the
presence of alcohol, and, if the flavor be objected to, many of
them can be taken in the form of coated pills.</p>

<p>“The external use of cold, either by a dripping sheet, cold
sponging, or a shower-bath, according to the power of reaction,
is a valuable means of giving real tone.</p>

<p>“Wine is frequently prescribed for those young persons who
are growing rapidly, and whose strength does not seem to keep
pace with their growth. It is important to know that alcohol is
not desirable in such circumstances. There is often found in
such cases a defective appetite, perhaps even sub-acute gastric
catarrh, which may be due to imperfect mastication through bad
teeth, or aggravated by it. There are other causes, such as late
hours, bad habits, improper food or irregular meals. In such
cases those means must be resorted to which are so effectual in
improving the condition and strengthening the heart of athletes.
Regular and regulated meals, exercise in the fresh air, a good
amount of rest and sleep&mdash;these will do more than anything
else to invigorate the bodily health.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Although I was taught, like all others, to use alcohol as a
tonic when patients were sick, to hasten their recovery and promote
their strength, yet it did not take me very long to find out
that here and there was one already a teetotaler who would not
take wine long, nor any kind of alcoholic drink unless prescribed,
just as castor-oil, dose by dose, but who, when he got beyond
the necessity of having it as a medicine, took no more. What
was the comparison? My patients who refused, or did not take
alcohol, got strong quicker and had less tendency to relapse
than those who continued its use. Here was the first step in
progress, and consequently I came soon to cease the recommending
it merely to hasten recovery of strength. As a tonic,
I found it of no value.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. James Miller, of Edinburgh, says in <i>Alcohol,
Its Place and Power</i>, written many years ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It may be well here to correct an important error, yet very
current, in regard to the medicinal use of alcohol. People
regard it as a simple and common tonic; and are ready to
accept its supposed help as such in every form of weakness and
general disorder of health. But it is ordinarily, no true tonic.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ernest Hart, editor of the <i>British Medical
Journal</i>, stated some years ago at a meeting of the
British Medical Temperance Association that “the
medical profession were nearly all agreed that alcohol
is neither a food nor a tonic.”</p>

<p>Many drunkards have been made, especially
among women, by the delusion that alcohol has
tonic effect. As a sample of these sad cases the
following is given, taken from a recent number of
<i>The National Advocate</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is in the jail at Elizabeth, N. J., a woman who was
arrested while participating in wild drunken orgies with a gang
of tramps in the woods near the town. She appears nothing
but a besotted hag, but was only a short time ago a dutiful wife
of a respectable man, and the mother of three beautiful children.
Her father, who is said to be living in a village in New York
State, is a highly respected minister of the Methodist Episcopal
Church. Her children are in an asylum, and her husband is a
wanderer in the West. The cause of her ruin was beer, prescribed
for her by the family physician as a tonic. At first she
refused to take it, having always been a teetotaler, but persuaded
to obey the physician, she soon acquired a taste for the
drink that speedily developed into the overmastering appetite,
which has brought her and hers to this sad condition.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>


<h4>ALCOHOL AS A SEDATIVE.</h4>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge says in the <i>Medical Pioneer</i>, April,
1893:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol, chiefly in the form of spirits, is often given to procure
sleep and to relieve pain, such as that of neuralgia,
dyspepsia, colic and diarrhœa. It is as a sedative that alcohol
is so insidious and seductive in cases of chronic disease, as, if
frequently resorted to, the drink craving is almost certainly
developed. Hence the importance in many cases of rather
bearing the ills we have than of flying to others that we know
not of. It is clear that other narcotics, such as opium, morphia,
chorodyne, chloral, are open to the same objection, and the
victims of these drugs are terribly numerous. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In
many instances some form of dyspepsia is the cause of the
sleeplessness, palpitation or other uneasy feeling for which a
sedative is desired, and when this is cured the symptoms
vanish.”</p></div>

<p>A prominent minister in a large American city
was afflicted with insomnia a few years ago, and,
after trying various remedies, was advised by a
physician to try whisky “night-caps.” He became
a hopeless drunkard. A young medical student in
New York appealed to one of his professors for aid
in overcoming aggravated insomnia. The professor
advised whisky and morphine! The advice led to
the ruin of the young man.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOL AS AN ANTIPYRETIC.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“By the power of alcohol to retard the evolution of heat in
retarding molecular changes in the tissues, the liquids containing
it may be used as antipyretics when the temperature is too
high, and to retard the processes of waste when these are too
rapid. But the antipyretic influence of alcohol is so feeble in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>comparison with the proper application of water to the surface,
or with the internal administration of sulphate of quinia, salicylic
acid, digitalis, etc. that no one thinks of using it for antipyretic
purposes.”&mdash;Dr. N. S. Davis in <i>Principles and Practice
of Medicine</i>.</p></div>


<h4>PROFESSOR ATWATER’S CONCLUSIONS UPON ALCOHOL
AS A FUEL-FOOD.</h4>

<p>In 1899 a decided sensation was caused by the announcement
that Prof. Atwater, of Middletown,
Conn., had proved that alcohol is a fuel-food equal
in value to carbohydrates and fats. The study later
of Prof. Atwater’s report of his investigations led to
prolonged discussions among medical men interested
in the alcohol question, and his theory that alcohol is
a food because it is oxidized in the body was vigorously
opposed by many scientists of high standing.
Professor Abel, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
an investigator of alcohol who worked with the
Committee of Fifty, said on this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Oxidizability cannot be made the measure of usefulness
in regard to this substance.”</p></div>

<p>Professor Gruber, president of the Royal Institute
of Hygiene, Munich, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Does alcohol truly deserve to be called a food substance?
Obviously, only such substances can be called food material,
or be employed for food, as, like albumen, fat, and sugar,
exert non-poisonous influence in the amounts in which they
reach the blood and must circulate in it in order to nourish
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Although alcohol contributes energy it diminishes
working ability. We are not able to find that its energy
is turned to account for nerve and muscle work. Very
small amounts, whose food value is insignificant, show an injurious
effect upon the nervous system.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Victor Horsley, the well-known London surgeon,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We know that alcohol lowers the temperature of the body.
It can only do that by diminishing the activity of the vital
processes. It also diminishes very greatly the power of the
muscles, and it diminishes the intellectual power of the nervous
system. To call an agent that causes such diminution of
activity throughout the whole body a food is ridiculous.”</p></div>

<p>An editorial in the <i>Journal of the <a name="Page_129t" id="Page_129t"></a><a href="#Page_129tn">American</a> Medical
Association</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The fallacy of the reasoning which would place alcohol
among the foods is very apparent when we put it in the
form of a syllogism: All foods are oxidized in the body;
alcohol is oxidized in the body; therefore alcohol is food.
As logically we might say: ‘All birds are bilaterally symmetrical;
the earthworm is bilaterally symmetrical; therefore
the earthworm is a bird.’ Oxidation within the body is
simply one of several important properties of food, as bilateral
symmetry is one of several important characteristics
of a bird.”</p></div>

<p>Schafer’s Physiology says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It cannot be doubted that any small production of energy
resulting from the oxidation of alcohol is more than counterbalanced
by its deleterious influences as a drug upon the
tissue elements, and especially upon those of the nervous
system.”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Bulletin</i> of the A. M. T. A. for July, 1899,
contained an article upon Prof. Atwater by Dr. J.
H. Kellogg, from which the following is taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Starch, sugar and fats become foods or fuels only through
their assimilation. Abundant physiological evidence attests
that no substance can act as a food, or as a true source of energy,
unless it has first entered into the composition of the body. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>must be assimilated. The forces manifested by the body, the
muscular forces, or nervous energy, are the result of the breaking
down of organized structure into simpler forms. For
example, in the case of nervous energy, material from which
nerve energy is derived is stored up in the nerve cell, and can
be seen with the microscope in the form of minute granules,
which disappear as the cell energy is expended, leaving the cell
blank and shriveled when in a state of extreme fatigue from
overwork. The same is essentially true of the muscle cell.
The source of muscular energy is glycogen, an organized substance
which becomes a part of the muscle tissue in a well-nourished
muscle in a state of rest.</p>

<p>“Experiments have clearly shown that fat, sugar and starch
must all alike be converted into the form of glycogen and enter
into the muscle structure before they can become a source of
energy.</p>

<p>“Professor Atwater tells us that alcohol can not form tissue,
hence the query is pertinent, How can it be a source of vital
energy? The body does not burn food as a stove does fuel.
Food can be called fuel only in a highly figurative sense. The
oxidation of food in the body does not take place directly.
Food is assimilated, becoming a part of the tissue. Oxygen is
also assimilated, entering into the composition of the tissue
along with the food elements under the action of special
organic ferments brought into play by nervous impulses received
from the central ganglia.</p>

<p>“The molecules of these residual tissues which form the
storehouse of energy in the body are rearranged in simpler
forms, thereby giving up a portion of the energy which holds
them together in the state in which they exist in the tissues,
and this energy thus set free appears as muscle force, mental
activity, glandular work and various other forms of functional
activity.”</p></div>

<h3>ALCOHOL IN PHARMACY.</h3>


<p>In the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
for November 13, 1897, Dr. T. D. Crothers,
editor of the <i>Journal of Inebriety</i>, says in a paper
upon “Concealed Alcohol in Drugs”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A very important question has been repeatedly raised, and
answered differently by persons who claim to have some
expert knowledge. The question is, can strong tinctures of
common drugs be given in all cases with safety; tinctures of
the various bitters which contain from 10 to 40 per cent. of
alcohol, and are used very freely by neurotic and debilitated
persons? It is asserted with the most positive convictions that
such tinctures are more sought for the narcotic effect of the
alcohol than for the drugs themselves.</p>

<p>“In my experience a large number of inebriates who are
restored, relapse from the use of these tinctures given for their
medicinal effects. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The question is asked, how much alcohol can be used as a
solvent in drugs without adding a new force more potent than
that which is brought out by the alcohol? Opinions of experts
differ. One writer thinks 10 per cent. of alcohol in any drug
will, if given any length of time, develop the physiologic effect
of alcohol in addition to that of the drug. An English writer
says that in some cases a 5 per cent. tincture is dangerous from
the alcohol which it contains.</p>

<p>“There is some doubt expressed by many authorities as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>the potency of a drug which is covered up in a strong tincture.
It is clear that the value of a drug is not enhanced, and it is
certain that a new force-producing, or exploding agency, has
been added to the body.</p>

<p>“In experience, any drug which contains alcohol can not be
given to persons who have previously used it without rousing up
the old desire for drink, or at least producing a degree of irritation
and excitement that clearly comes from this source. It is
also the experience of persons who are very susceptible to alcohol,
that any strong tincture is followed by headache and other
symptoms that refer to disturbed nerve centres.</p>

<p>“In many studies I have been surprised at the increased action
of drugs when given in other forms than the tincture. Gum
and powdered opium, have far more pronounced narcotic action
than the tincture. Yet the tincture is followed by a more rapid
narcotism, but of shorter duration, and attended with more
nerve disturbance at the onset.</p>

<p>“I am convinced that a more exact knowledge of the physiologic
action of alcohol on the organism will show that its use
in drugs as tinctures is dangerous and will be abandoned.</p>

<p>“There are many reasons for believing that its use in proprietary
drugs will be punished in the future under what is
called the poison act.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge published in May, 1893, in the
<i>Medical Pioneer</i>, the following statement of the
pharmacy of the London Temperance Hospital:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When the Temperance Hospital was first opened, it became
a question of practical importance, what should be done with
regard to the alcohol so largely employed as a vehicle and drug
excipient. Not that the principle of the treatment of disease
without the ordinary administration of alcoholic beverages precludes
the employment of alcoholic tinctures, but it was felt that
in such a test case as this it was important to obviate the objec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>tion
that while withholding alcohol as a beverage, it was given
in the medicine. As a matter of fact, it is surprising, when one
looks into it, how much alcohol is often given merely as a vehicle
for other drugs, and without the special action of alcohol
being required or desired. In prescriptions which are to be
seen in many text-books, it is not uncommon to find from one
to two or three, or even four drachms of rectified spirit in the
form of tinctures or spirits. This is very undesirable. If alcohol
is needed it should be given in proper measured dose.
But if it is not indicated, then it is not well to administer it in
this indirect manner.</p>

<p>“Experiments were therefore made, partly at the hospital
and specially by Messrs. Southall Bros. &amp; Barclay, of Birmingham,
with the result that new non-alcoholic tinctures were
made replacing the following alcoholic tinctures and wines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>“These were made by extracting the principles of the drugs
in the usual way except that instead of alcohol a mixture of
glycerine and water was used in the proportion of one-fourth to
one-third part of glycerine, and about five per cent. of acetic
acid. These made very elegant preparations, and in the majority
of cases appeared to have just the same, and just as great
physiological action. Subsequently the ordinary tinctures were
distilled, and the extracts thus obtained dissolved in the above
menstruum, as far as was possible, in most cases the residuum
being found to be inert.</p>

<p>“Gum resins and essential oils were found to be insoluble in
this menstruum, and hence such drugs have been given in the
form of pill, powder or mixture. Such tinctures are those of
assafœtida, benzoin, cannabis indica, cantharides, castor, cubebs,
lavender, myrrh, pyrethrum, sumbul, tolu and ginger. Out of
62 tinctures it was found that 46 made good preparations, and
16 did not.</p>

<p>“These were employed for several years. But for some time
past, somewhat more reliable preparations have been made for
us which contain <i>all</i> the constituents of the alcoholic tinctures
without the alcohol. They are for the most part made by taking
standardized tinctures, mixing with them sugar of milk, and
distilling off the alcohol. The alcoholic extract remains behind
in a finely divided condition mingled with sugar of milk. This
is broken up, pulverized and compressed into tabloids of a
definite dose, which can be taken either in that form or rubbed
up and dissolved or suspended in gum water.</p>

<p>“The following have been made up in this form: aconite,
belladonna, camph. co., cannabis indica, capsicum, cinchon. co.,
and cinchon. simpl., digitalis, gelseminum, hyosciamus, nux
vomica, opium, strophanthus, ginger and Warburg. Other tinctures
will be gradually added to this list.</p>

<p>“As external liniments those commonly used are the linimentum
terebinthinæ and the linimentum terebinthinæ aceticum,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>which do not contain alcohol. A strong solution of iodine is
made with iodide of potassium.</p>

<p>“The spiritus ammoniæ aromaticus is made without the spirit,
the aromatic oils being emulsionized by means of rubbing up
with fine sand, but most of these subsequently rise to the surface.
The spiritus etheris nitrosi is impossible without alcohol,
but nitrite of amyl, and nitrites of potash or soda can be substituted.
The spiritus chloroformi is replaced by aqua chloroformi,
or as a sweetening agent by solution of saccharin. Thus a favorite
expectorant mixture contains carbonate of ammonia five
grains, acetum ipecac, ten minims, and solution of saccharin in
each dose.</p>

<p>“As a special stimulant a subcutaneous injection of a drachm
of pure ether has been given in a few cases; in others digitalis,
or caffeine or ammonia in some form, such as the carbonate
dissolved in a cup of hot coffee; or hot solution of Liebig’s
extract, or rectal injections of hot water.”</p></div>

<p>It may be objected by some that glycerine belongs
to the family of alcohols, hence hospitals
using glycerine tinctures are not, strictly speaking,
non-alcoholic. To this the answer is, that while
glycerine certainly is classed in the family of alcohols,
it is of a very different nature from ethyl
alcohol, which is used for beverage purposes.
Ethyl alcohol, the alcohol in all intoxicating beverages
in common use, and the alcohol generally used
in medicine, creates a fatal craving for itself, and is
injurious to the body. Glycerine does not create
any craving for itself, and has not been demonstrated
to have injurious properties, and is not used for
beverage purposes.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the New York State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Medical Society, held in New York City, in October,
1898, a discussion was held upon the use of alcohol
as medicine. Dr. E. R. Squibb, a leading pharmacist
of Brooklyn, stated that during the last two or
three years much had been accomplished in retiring
alcohol as a menstruum for exhausting drugs. Of
the other menstrua experimented with up to the
present time, that which had given the best results
was acetic acid, in various strengths. It had been
discovered that a ten per cent. solution of acetic
acid was almost universal in its exhausting powers.
There were now in use in veterinary practice, and
in some hospitals, extracts made with acetic acid.
They were made according to the requirements of
the pharmacopœia, except that acetic acid was
substituted for alcohol. Acetic acid, when used
with alkaloids gives the physician some advantages
in prescribing, owing to there being fewer incompatibles.
In small doses, the percentage of acetic
acid in the extract is so small as to be hardly
appreciable, and when larger doses are required,
the acetic acid can be neutralized by the addition
of potash or soda.</p>

<p>Dr. Noble said, in article to <i>London Times</i> before
referred to:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Modern science has shown that those drugs which are
soluble in alcohol only, are, in all probability, more hurtful than
useful.”</p></div>

<p>The following from Dr. Jas. R. Nichols, editor
Boston <i>Journal of Chemistry</i>, is too good to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>omitted, although it should be familiar to temperance
students:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The facetious Dr. Holmes has said, that if the contents of
our drug-stores were taken out upon the ocean and thrown
overboard, it would be better for the human race, but worse for
the fishes. This statement may be a little sweeping; but it is
true that all the showy bottles in drug-stores which contain
alcoholic decoctions and tinctures might be submerged in
the ocean, and invalids would suffer no detriment. Since the
active alkaloidal and resinoidal principles of roots, barks and
gums have been isolated and put in better and more convenient
forms, there is no longer need of alcoholic tinctures and elixirs.
Laudanum, which is a tincture of opium, might be banished
from the shelves of every apothecary, as it is not needed. It is
now known that the valuable narcotic and hypnotic principles
of opium are contained in certain crystalline bodies, which can
be isolated, and used in minute and convenient forms, and that
they can be held in aqueous solutions. Alcohol is no longer
needed to hold the active principles of opium, Peruvian bark
or other indispensable drugs. As regards the vegetable tonics
so called, the best among them is the columbo (Radix columbo)
and this readily yields its bitter principle to water, as does
quassia, gentian, senna, rhubarb and most other valuable substances.
A careful survey of the contents of a well-appointed
modern pharmacy leads to the conclusion that there is no one
indispensable medicinal preparation which requires alcohol as a
free constituent.</p>

<p>“The catalogue of modern remedies is almost endless, and
many of them hold alcohol in some form; but every intelligent
physician knows that 90 per cent. of these alleged remedies
have little or no intrinsic value. The nostrums of the quack,
the bitters, elixirs, cordials, extracts, etc. nearly all contain alcohol,
and this is the ingredient which aids their sale. The
whole unclean list might, with advantage to mankind, be
thrown to the fishes.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>“The chemist, more particularly the pharmaceutical chemist,
may inquire how he is to conduct his processes without alcohol.
It is from the pharmaceutical laboratory we derive some of
the most important substances used in medicines and the arts.
Among them may be named ether, chloroform and chloral hydrate,
three of the most indispensable agents known to science,
and the employment of alcohol is essential to their production.
Alcohol is a laboratory product; it is a chemical agent which
belongs to the laboratory; it is the handmaid of the chemist,
and, so long as it exists, should be retained within the walls of
the laboratory. In the manufacture of most of the important
products in which alcohol is either directly or indirectly used,
its production may be made simultaneous with the production
of the agent desired. In the manufacture of ether and chloroform,
the apparatus for alcohol may be made a part of the devices
from which the ultimate agents, ether and chloroform,
result. Fermentation and distillation may be conducted at one
end, and the anæsthetics received at the other. It is true that
in a chemical laboratory alcohol is an agent very convenient in
a thousand ways. But, if it were banished utterly, what would
result? There are other methods of fabricating the useful
products named, and many others, without the use of alcohol,
but the processes would be rather inconvenient and more costly.
The banishment of alcohol would not deprive us of a single one
of the indispensable agents which modern civilization demands,
and neither would chemical science be retarded by its loss.”</p>

<p>“It must be remembered that modern science has given us
glycerine, naptha, bisulphide of carbon, pyroligneous products,
carbolic acid and a hundred other agents which are capable of
taking the place of alcohol in a very large number of appliances
and processes.”</p></div>

<p>The sale of liquor in drug-stores is beginning to
be deplored by the more respectable pharmacists.
At the annual meeting of the Massachusetts State<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Pharmacists’ Association in 1895 the president said
in his address:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“One thing that every pharmacist, who has the best interests
of his calling at heart, must bear in mind is that the liquor part
of their business is being, and must be, slowly crowded out.
Public sentiment has changed greatly in the last few years, and
instead of all being classed alike, the line has been sharply
drawn, and the stores that sell the least amount of liquor that
they possibly can are gaining the confidence and esteem of the
public, and consequently their business is growing from year to
year, while the others are losing ground and dropping lower
and lower.”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Evening Record</i> of Boston contained the following
in its issue of March 7, 1896:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The number of flagrant offences on the part of druggists in
certain no-license towns&mdash;offences not only against the liquor
laws, but also against the laws of decency and humanity&mdash;brought
before the board of pharmacy, would appall the public
if they were known. The Looker-On has seen the record of
several of these druggists as transcribed from the police courts
and they are very black records. One druggist after selling
liquor over and over again to one customer, and several times
getting him completely intoxicated, finally deposited him one
night in a snowbank, in a state of frozen stupor, where he
would have frozen to death had not the wife of the druggist’s
clerk threatened to complain to the police unless he was rescued.</p>

<p>“The story is told of one of the druggists of a neighboring
no-license town. A man came in and asked for a pint of
whisky. He was asked what he wanted it for. His reply was
that he wanted it to soak some roots in. He got it, and as he
went out he dryly remarked, ‘I should have told you that it
was the roots of me tongue that I want to soak.’”</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>DISEASES, AND THEIR TREATMENT WITHOUT
ALCOHOL.</h3>


<p>The question, “What shall I take instead of
wine, beer or brandy?” is frequently asked by
those who have been trained to think some form of
alcohol really necessary to the cure of disease, but,
who, from principle would prefer other agents, if
they knew of any equal in effect. This chapter
deals somewhat with the answer to that question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcoholic Craving</span>:&mdash;The craving for alcohol
may be present for a time after a person has commenced
to abstain from all beverages containing it.
Or, it may occur periodically, as a sort of irresistible
impulse. For the periodical craving Dr. Higginbotham,
of England, recommends that a half drachm
of ipecacuanha be taken so as to produce full vomiting.
He says the desire for intoxicating drinks will
be immediately removed. The craving is caused by
vitiated secretions of the stomach; the vomiting
removes these. Dr. Higginbotham says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If a patient can be persuaded to follow the emetic plan for
a few times when the periodical attacks come on, he will be
effectually cured.”</p></div>

<p>Some men in trying to abstain have found the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>use of fresh fruit, especially apples, very helpful.
Nourishing and digestible food should be taken
somewhat frequently. A cup of hot milk or hot
coffee taken at the right moment has saved some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anæmia</span>:&mdash;In this complaint there is a deficiency
of the red corpuscles of the blood. It may be
the result of some fever or exhausting illness; it
may accompany dyspepsia, and is then due to imperfect
digestion and assimilation of the food.
The poverty of the blood produces shortness of
breath, and often palpitation of the heart also,
especially on a little exertion. There is generally
more or less weariness, languor and debility, sometimes
also giddiness, sickness, fainting and neuralgia.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In the treatment of anæmia, port wine and other alcoholic
liquors are worse than useless.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. J. Ridge</span>, London.</p>

<p>“The common prescription of wine or some form of spirits
for states of general exhaustion and anæmia, is a serious mistake.
It assumes that the temporary increase in the action of the heart
is renewed vigor, and that some power is added to the failing
energies. This theory rests solely on the statement of the
patient that he feels better. In reality the exhaustion is intensified,
though covered up.”&mdash;<i>Medical Pioneer.</i></p>

<p>“Deficiency of nutrition, of light and of pure air may be
mentioned as common causes of anæmia. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It is
evident that the first step in the treatment of this disease is to
remove the cause. If the cause is dyspepsia, this must receive
attention; if intestinal parasites, they must be dislodged; if
prolonged nursing, nursing must be interdicted; if too little
food, a larger quantity of nourishing, wholesome food must be
employed. Such simple and easily digested foods as eggs,
poached or boiled, boiled milk, kumyzoon, good buttermilk,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>purée of peas, beans or lentils, boiled rice, well-cooked gruels
and other preparations of grains are suitable. Beef tea and
extracts are worthless. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“A careful course of physical training is essential to securing
perfect recovery in cases of chronic anæmia due to indigestion,
or any other serious disturbance of the nutritive processes.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
J. H. Kellogg.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appetite, Loss of</span>:&mdash;“There is often disinclination for
food because <i>it is not required</i>. Many cannot eat much breakfast,
because they have had a hearty supper. Or having had
both a hearty breakfast and luncheon, they feel but little desire
for a dinner of four or five courses. Generally the stomach is
right and the habits wrong. What is to be done then, for
such lack of appetite? Simply go without food until appetite
comes.</p>

<p>“When ale or beer is taken regularly with meals the stomach
learns to expect them, and the food is not relished without
them. The appetizing power of beer and bitter ales is chiefly
due to the hop or other bitter ingredients which they contain.
When it seems necessary to assist the appetite temporarily, a
small quantity of simple infusion of hops may be taken.</p>

<p>“Sometimes appetite fails because of exhaustion of body
and mind. This may be nature’s warning against overwork,
and cannot be neglected with impunity. Life will inevitably be
shortened if it is found necessary to rely upon the aid of
alcohol in any form in order to do a day’s work.</p>

<p>“Bouillon, or beef soup, at the beginning of a meal are incentives
to appetite. Change of scene, and life in the open
air are the very best aids to appetite, when aids are really required.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apoplexy</span>:&mdash;“There is a popular idea that whenever a person
is taken ill with giddiness, fainting or insensibility, brandy
should be at once procured and poured down his throat.
Nothing can be more dangerous in apoplexy. This disease is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>due to the bursting of some blood-vessel in the head, and the
poured-out blood presses on the brain and leads to more or less
insensibility. If fainting occurs, it may possibly save the
patient’s life, because then the blood-vessels contract, and the
flow of blood ceases immediately; time is thus given for the
ruptured blood-vessel to became sealed up by a clot, which will
prevent further loss of blood. If brandy is given, there is, first,
great risk of choking the patient; if that danger is escaped
and the brandy is swallowed and absorbed, the vessels become
relaxed and the heart recovers its force; hence the ruptured
vessel, if not sufficiently sealed by clot, may be started again,
and fatal hemorrhage result.</p>

<p>“The only <i>treatment</i> which unskilled hands can adopt is to
lay the patient on his back on the floor or sofa with the head
and shoulders somewhat raised; to loosen all the dress round
the neck and body; to apply cold to the head and hot flannels
or a hot bottle to the feet and hands, or to soak them in hot
mustard and water, and to gently rub the arms and legs.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
J. J. Ridge.</span></p></div>

<p>Dr. Alfred Smee, surgeon to the Bank of England,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Give nothing by the mouth. Apply a stream of cold water
to the head. If the feet are cold apply warm cloths. If relief
is not soon obtained, apply hot fomentations to the abdomen,
keeping the head erect.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bed-Sores</span>:&mdash;Some object to using alcohol even
as an outward application. Dr. Ridge recommends
that when a patient is confined to bed the parts
pressed on be well washed every day with strong
salt and water or alum water, and carefully dried.
<i>Glycerine of Tannin</i> may then be applied. If any
redness appears, especially if any dusky patch is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>formed, <i>collodion</i> may be applied with a brush, and
all pressure should be taken off the part by a circular
air-pillow or by a cushion; or small bran or
sand-bags may be made and carefully arranged. If
the skin is broken, <i>zinc</i> or <i>resin ointment</i> may be
applied.</p>

<p>Some recommend finely powdered iodoform
sprinkled over the surface of the sore.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Boils and Carbuncle</span>:&mdash;“In many cases these troubles
result from an overloaded condition of the system, which is the
result of taking too much food, or some error in diet. The
boils are an effort of nature to be rid of offending matter. In
some cases they are due to the use of impure water, or the
presence of sewer gas in the house. In others, overwork, or
other debilitating causes, may have produced the state of the
digestive organs which usually causes the boils. Carbuncle is,
essentially, an extensive boil.</p>

<p>“Apply iodine early or a piece of belladonna plaster. The
diet should be plain and unstimulating, condiments being
avoided and plenty of fresh vegetables taken, if possible.
Fresh-air, exercise and proper rest should be obtained, and
late hours avoided.</p>

<p>“Medical advice is requisite in carbuncle. The popular
notion that port wine is absolutely necessary is both erroneous
and mischievous.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ridge.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Catarrh</span>:&mdash;Among the causes are repeated
colds; errors in diet, especially excess in the use of
fats and sugar, and an inactive state of the liver.</p>

<p>Cut off from your bill of fare all salted foods,
avoid fats and condiments; drink freely of pure
water; live in the open-air and sunshine as much as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>possible, taking much out-door exercise. Take a
cold sponge or towel bath every morning, beginning
at the face and finishing by plunging the feet into
a foot-tub. Follow with vigorous rubbing with a
crash or Turkish towel. Those subject to sore
throat should hold the head over a basin of cold
water and lave the neck with the water for about
two minutes. The writer was formerly subject to
frequent sore throats, but has had none for over
two years, as she believes, because of the adoption
of this measure, together with the towel bath every
morning, summer and winter.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to avoid exposure to
draughts, or any other means which will produce liability
to cold. Care in diet, good ventilation and the
morning cold bath are essential if a radical cure is desired.
Local measures, while giving relief, will not
remove the predisposing causes. Dr. Kellogg recommends
saline solutions in the form of the nasal
douche, a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of soft water,
adding twenty to thirty drops of carbolic acid, if
there is offensive odor, as a relief measure.</p>

<p>Sleeping in a poorly ventilated room is said to be
one cause of catarrh.</p>

<p><i>Hay Fever</i> is a form of catarrh. The vapor
bath is recommended as very helpful in this trouble.
<i>Nature Cure</i> says that two vapor baths and a two
or three days’ fast will cure any case of hay fever.
The use of pork and other clogging foods should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>avoided by those afflicted with this trouble. The
bowels should be kept in good condition. If constipated,
the use of prunes, figs, grapes, apples and
other such fruits will be very beneficial; walking,
and massage of the bowels, being added if the fruits
are not sufficient. No one able to walk should
depend upon drugs to relieve a constipated condition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Colds</span>:&mdash;“If the bowels are constipated, the skin over-burdened
and clogged with bilious matter, and the lungs weak,
it is as easy to take cold as to roll off a log. If, on the contrary,
the lungs are well developed, and the respiratory power
large, providing abundant oxygen to keep bright the internal
fires, the colon clean, the skin daily washed, and the system
hardened by the cold bath, taking cold is next to impossible.</p>

<p>“The first remedial agent for a cold should be a copious
enema. Then open the pores of the skin by a hot bath; take a
glass of hot lemonade and go to bed.”&mdash;<i>The New Hygiene.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chills</span>:&mdash;For chill, take a hot foot and hand
bath, with mustard in the water, ¼ pound to a
gallon; then go to bed in a well ventilated room.
Drink freely of hot lemonade or hot water. Catarrh,
colds and hay fever may all be effectually relieved
by hot baths. Relief may be gained also
from inhaling the vapor from pine needles or hemlock
leaves. Put them in a bowl, pour boiling
water over them, hold the face down over the bowl,
the head being covered, and inhale the vapor well
up into the nostrils and head. A few drops of
hemlock oil in the hot water will do as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coughs and Hoarseness</span>:&mdash;Boil flaxseed in 1
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>pint water, strain, add two teaspoons honey, 1
ounce rock candy, and juice 3 lemons. Drink hot.
Also; roast a lemon till hot, cut, and squeeze on 3
ounces powdered sugar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colic</span>:&mdash;This may arise from cold, or from error
in diet. If the latter it is desirable to induce
vomiting. For the pain, apply hot flannels or
fomentations; drink hot water. In severe cases,
sprinkle a little turpentine on flannel, wrung from hot
water, and apply to abdomen. Colic resulting from
the accumulation of fecal matter should be treated
with hot enemas until relieved. A hot hip-bath is
sometimes necessary to relief.</p>

<p>The colic of children and infants should never be
treated with alcoholics. In infants it generally
arises from excessive or improper feeding; care
should be taken that the milk provided them is not
sour.</p>

<p>In severe cases the babe should be immersed in
warm water, keeping the head above water, of
course. This is also the best remedy in convulsions.
The hot bath, with a copious enema of
warm water, has saved the lives of many babes.</p>

<p>For adults, hot water, with a pinch of red pepper
added, will do all that brandy can do, and more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cholera</span>:&mdash;Brandy has been considered by many
a really necessary medicine in cholera. The following
is a discussion upon Alcohol in Cholera which
was held at the annual meeting of the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Medical Temperance Association, in May, 1893, and
is taken from the <i>Medical Pioneer</i> of June, 1893:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Dr. Richardson opened a discussion on Cholera in relation
to Alcohol. He said he would bring forward five points on the
subject.</p>

<p>1. The negligence among the people at large produced by
alcohol in the presence of a cholera epidemic. There was no
doubt on the part of any who had seen an epidemic of cholera
as to the mischief done by alcohol, apart from its action as a
remedy. People rush to the public houses and take it to ward
off the danger, or to relieve them when they begin to feel ill,
and the result is very bad morally. He had seen this in different
epidemics. Or people got in spirits to face the danger, and
many became intoxicated and less able to resist.</p>

<p>2. Its misuse by those affected. It was often given to cheer
them up and remove their fear and nervousness. In his opinion
it invariably produced mischief.</p>

<p>3. He was unable to find any physiological reason for giving
it. There was a constant drain of fluid, causing spasms and
cramp, both of the muscles and blood-vessels, and difficult circulation
through the lungs. Spasm may be relaxed by alcohol,
but, on the other hand, alcohol is exceedingly greedy of water,
and so increases the flux. But it also reduces animal temperature,
which is a strong feature of cholera, so much so that he
could almost diagnose cholera blindfold in the stage of collapse,
by the icy coldness.</p>

<p>4. Its uselessness as a remedy during the acute stage. He
had seen a great deal of cholera and never saw alcohol do any
good whatever. There was a temporary glow which passed
away in a few minutes, and then the evil it does in other ways
was brought out. Water was far better, even if cold. The
College of Physicians had given some instructions and ordered
great care in the administration of alcohol; this was not far
enough, but good as far as it went. The recoveries were best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>where the treatment was simplest, such as external warmth
with plenty of diluents. He had given creasote largely.</p>

<p>5. Its injuriousness during the stage of reaction. The reactive
fever following collapse caused a great number of deaths.
In this stage alcohol was absolutely poisonous. He could recall
many such cases in which he had given alcohol through
ignorance, and always with disaster.</p>

<p>“Brigade-Surgeon Pringle said that when he went out to India
he thought alcohol was something to stand by, but he had soon
found out his mistake; he had himself suffered from it. He could
confirm what Dr. Richardson had said as to the demoralization
produced by alcohol to which men resort to keep up their
spirits, and men seized under these circumstances were in the
greatest danger. Nature effects a cure in many cases without
assistance, and often with wonderful rapidity. People apparently
dead and about to be buried, he had known to get up
and recover. When alcohol is given during collapse there is
often no absorption until reaction occurs, and then the quantity
accumulated speedily produces intoxication. It was the same
with opium: he had found pills unchanged in the stomach for
hours. He recommended hot drinks; he had tried every kind
of medicine and had little faith in it. The nursing was very
important, and it was important that the nurses should abstain.</p>

<p>“Dr. Morton said it was easy to see that on physiological
grounds alone, alcohol, with its strong affinity for water and its
tendency to lower temperature, could not be a useful drug in
the treatment of cholera collapse, and with its powers of paralyzing
vascular inhibition and checking elimination of effete
matter, could not be otherwise than harmful in the stage of reaction.
As these conclusions were corroborated by practical
experience he did not think members would hesitate to banish
it from their equipment against cholera.</p>

<p>“Dr. Ridge said it should be remembered that Doyen had
made experiments on guinea-pigs and had found they were
proof against cholera, unless they had previously had a dose of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>alcohol. This explained why drunkards and hard drinkers
were so much more liable to have cholera, and have it badly as
all observers declared to be the case. Another reason might
be that small quantities of alcohol, such as would be found circulating
in the blood, favored the growth and multiplication
of bacteria, certainly those of decomposition, and probably
those of cholera. Hence, other things being equal, the abstainer
had a great advantage.</p>

<p>“Dr. Norman Kerr said that he had observed both in America
and Glasgow that not only notorious drunkards but free
drinkers suffered; abstainers were less liable unless they took
contaminated water, and the less liquid taken the less chance
of taking cholera; beer-drinkers often took more than abstainers.
The alcohol-drinker uses up more water from his blood
and so has less to flush out the system. Alcohol, given to a
patient, disguised his condition so that he might seem better
though really worse. Hence it is better and safer not to give
any. The doctors and nurses ought to be abstainers. A doctor
after dinner was more likely to take a roseate view of a
case, looking at it through an alcoholic pair of spectacles. Alcohol
was not really a stimulant, but a depressant, and this is a
very depressing disease; it was important to have our vital resisting
power as vigorous as possible. Hot water both relaxes
and stimulates, and the whole cry of the sufferer is for water.
Many persons who died in cholera did not die of the disease,
but of the drugs such as alcohol and opium. Acid drinks
should be given, as the bacilli could not live in acid mixtures.
Cholera might come, but he believed we were better prepared
to meet it and to treat it.</p>

<p>“Surgeon-General Francis sent a communication which was
read by the Honorable Secretary. He said: ‘Having had
many opportunities of treating cholera in various parts of India
and amongst all classes, I have no hesitation in affirming that
alcohol in any shape is one of the very worst remedies. Life
is, so to speak, paralyzed, and we give a remedy which, appar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ently
stimulating, is in reality, a paralyzer and therefore mischievous;
the death-rate might be considerably reduced provided
alcohol were rigidly excluded.’”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Norman Kerr in a valuable paper upon
Cholera says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The first thing is to get rid of the poison. How? By assisting
it out; but alcohol keeps it in by blocking the doors,
just as the doors were blocked in the terrible calamity at Sunderland
not long ago. The alcohol makes the heart and circulation
labor more. Alcohol not only retains the cholera poison,
but retards the action of the heart. Brandy and opium used to
be employed, but the records show that if the object had been
to make cholera as fatal as possible, that object was achieved
by the indiscriminate administration of brandy and opium.
Better leave the victim alone, and his chances of recovery will
be greater than if he have a thousand doctors, and as many
nurses, administering to him brandy and opium. Alcohol is
especially dangerous in the third stage, that of reactive fever,
because it adds to the fever. Then, alcohol is not only unsafe
in the three stages of genuine cholera, but especially unsafe in
the premonitory diarrhœa stage, which gives nearly every one
warning before they are attacked by genuine cholera. Brandy
is taken simply because it puts away the pain. If there are
only the pain and slight diarrhœa, speaking medically, it is all
right, but if there is anything behind the pain, it is all wrong.
After the alcohol, the mischief is going on, only the patient does
not know it, and valuable time is lost. All the alcohol does is
to deaden sensation. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Here I can thoroughly recommend
ice and iced water. I have always treated cholera patients
with these. Let them drink iced water to their hearts’ content;
they can never drink too much; and this opinion is fortified by
that of Professor Maclean, of Netley. There is no need of a
substitute for brandy in cholera, because in ordinary circumstances
in that disease the action of a stimulant is bad. Flush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>ing
of the blood is required, and water will do it. Milk will
not do it, because it is too thick&mdash;nothing but pure, cold water,
all the better if iced.”</p></div>

<p>In 1893 Dr. Ernest Hart, editor of the <i>British
Medical Journal</i>, read an able paper upon Cholera
before the American Medical Association. His
argument was that the introduction of such a substance
as alcohol, itself being a product of germ action,
into a system already suffering from the toxic
influence of a ptomaine, could not be otherwise
than pernicious.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Cholera Morbus</span>:&mdash;Dr. Kellogg says: “The stomach
should be washed by means of the stomach-tube when possible.
A large hot enema should be given after each evacuation of
the bowels. The addition of tannin, one drachm to a quart of
water, is serviceable. When the vomited matter no longer
shows signs of food, efforts should be made to stop the vomiting.
Give the patient bits of ice the size of a bean to swallow
every few minutes. At the same time apply hot fomentations
over the stomach and bowels. If the patient suffer much from
cramp, put him into a warm bath. The first food taken should
be farinaceous. Oatmeal gruel, well boiled and strained, is
useful.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cholera Infantum</span>:&mdash;“Iced water may be given in very
small quantities every few minutes. Give the stomach entire
rest for at least twenty-four hours. There will be no suffering
for want of food as long as the stomach is in such a condition.
Withhold milk until nature has had time to rid the alimentary
canal of the poison-producing germs. White of egg dissolved
in water is an excellent preparation in these cases. Egg enemata
may also be advantageously used.</p>

<p>“Warm baths, the hot blanket pack when the surface is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>cold, and the hot enema are all useful. Keep the child wrapped
warmly.</p>

<p>“Great care should be taken in returning to the milk diet.
The milk should be thoroughly sterilized by boiling for half an
hour, and should be mixed with some barley water so as to
avoid the formation of large curds in the stomach. Cream,
diluted with water, may be used instead of milk.”</p></div>


<h4>CONSUMPTION.</h4>

<p>Dr. Koch, the celebrated German microscopist,
pronounces consumption contagious, because during
its progress a very minute bacterium is developed
which may be transmitted from one person to
another.</p>

<p>It is said that a person with healthy lungs might
daily breathe millions of tubercle bacilli without
any danger, and that the best preventive of this
disease is to live much in the open air, or if this is
impossible to spend ten or fifteen minutes a day in
deep breathing exercises in the open air. “Fresh-air
and disease-germs are antagonistic.”</p>

<p>Alcohol, chiefly in the form of whisky, was for
many years considered of great value in the treatment
of consumption of the lungs. Indeed, it was looked
upon not only as a curative, but also as a prophylactic,
or preventive, of great service to those predisposed to
this disease by reason of narrow chest and weak
lungs.</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson was the first
medical scientist who showed plainly that alcohol,
instead of being a preventive of consumption, is really
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>the sole cause of one type of this disease, the type
now classed under the head of “alcoholic phthisis.”
For this kind of phthisis there is no hope of cure.</p>

<p>French physicians some years ago came to the conclusion
that alcohol was a prolific cause of tuberculosis
and that the administration of alcoholic liquors in
tubercular troubles was a great error, and in the International
Anti-Tuberculosis Congress held in Paris in
1905, about 2000 medical scientists being present, they
presented the following resolution, which was adopted:
“In view of the close connection between alcoholism
and tuberculosis, this Congress strongly emphasizes
the importance of combining the fight against tuberculosis
with the struggle against alcoholism.”</p>

<p>Since that time a great crusade against tuberculosis
has been carried on by means of exhibits and lectures,
and in connection with these, almost invariably the
people are warned against intemperance. For example,
a pamphlet sent out by the Boston Association for
the Relief and Control of Tuberculosis says: “Do not
spend money for beer or other liquors, or for quack
medicines or ‘cures.’ Self-indulgence and intemperance
are very bad. Vice which weakens the strong
kills the weak.” The New York State Charities Aid
Association, working with the State Board of Health,
says in a pamphlet: “Patent medicines do not cure
consumption. They are usually alcoholic drinks in
disguise, and the use of alcoholic drinks is dangerous
to the consumptive.” At the great exhibit in Washington
in September, 1908, in connection with the International
Anti-Tuberculosis Congress different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>warnings against alcohol were upon the walls. Among
these was a large poster of white cloth on which was
printed the opinions on alcohol, in brief, of some of
the best-known authorities on consumption. The opinions
as given on that poster are given here, with
others, in order to show the great change of sentiment
regarding alcohol and consumption which has come
about within a few years:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol has never cured and never will cure tuberculosis.
It will either prevent or retard recovery. It is like a two-edged
weapon; on one side it poisons the system, and on
the other it ruins the stomach and thus prevents this organ
from properly digesting the necessary food.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">S. A. Knopf</span>,
M. D., New York, Honorary Vice-President of the British
Congress on Tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Dr. Knopf in his prize essay on “Tuberculosis and How to
Combat It,” says in several places: “Avoid all alcoholic beverages.”
He says also, “Alcohol should never be given to
children even in the smallest quantities.”</p>

<p>“It is a recognized fact in the medical profession that the
habitual use of alcoholic drinks predisposes to tubercular infection.
It is also recognized, I think, by most physicians
that alcohol as a medicine is harmful to the tubercular invalid.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Frank
Billings</span>, M. D., Chicago, Ill., Former President
American Medical Association.</p>

<p>“Alcoholic liquors are of damage to consumptives because
they tend to impair nutrition, disturb the action of the stomach,
and give a false strength to the invalid on which he is
sure to presume. Besides, we know that in countries where
drinking prevails most, the ravages of tuberculosis are most
marked.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edward L. Trudeau</span>, M. D., Adirondacks Sanitarium
for Consumptives, Saranac Lake, N. Y.</p>

<p>“In my judgment whisky should not be used by people who
have consumption, and in my practice I prohibit its use absolutely.
At the White Haven Sanitarium and Henry Phipps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Institute we do not use alcohol in any form in the treatment
of our patients.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lawrence F. Flick</span>, M. D., Vice-President
of the National Association for the Study and Prevention of
Tuberculosis, Philadelphia, Pa.</p>

<p>“I do not feel that I can emphasize strongly enough the
harm that can be done by the use of alcohol in tuberculosis,
and the indiscriminate use of it certainly borders on the
criminal. I do not believe that any legitimate reason can be
given for the routine employment of alcohol in the treatment
of tuberculosis. I furthermore know of no emergency in
which it is indispensable. My experience with patients who
have been accustomed to the use of alcohol, especially moderately,
is very unsatisfactory. They seem to show an abnormally
low resisting power to the tubercle bacillus. The
fact has been established that alcoholism is a very potent factor
in the causation of tuberculosis. I find it not only unnecessary
in treatment but believe it to be contraindicated.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">F. M.
Pottenger</span>, M. D., Superintendent the Pottenger Sanitarium
for Diseases of the Lungs and Throat, Monrovia,
California.</p>

<p>“I have met with a small class of consumptive patients who
could take alcoholic liquors freely for a length of time, without
deranging either the stomach or the brain, and with a
decided amelioration of the pulmonary symptoms, and an
arrest of the emaciation. Some of these have actually increased
in <i>embonpoint</i>, and for three to six months were
highly elated with the hope that they were recovering. But
truth compels me to say that I have never seen a case in
which this apparent improvement under the influence of alcoholic
drink was permanent. On the contrary, even in those
cases in which the emaciation seems at first arrested, and the
general symptoms ameliorated, the physical signs do not undergo
a corresponding improvement; and after a few months
the digestive function becomes impaired; the emaciation begins
to increase rapidly; and in a short time the patient is
fatally prostrated.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Nathan S. Davis, Sr.</span>, of Chicago.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>“The use of whisky in this disease positively interferes with
digestion which must under all circumstances be kept as perfect
as possible in order that the patient may assimilate the
food which is so necessary to the upbuilding of the system
and to gain strength to fight the onslaught of the disease.</p>

<p>“Its constant use would not only interfere with digestion
but would have a tendency to create disease in other organs
of the body so that we therefore consider the use of whisky
in tuberculosis positively contraindicated.</p>

<p>“Wishing you success in your laudable campaign.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. M.
Collins</span>, Superintendent National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives,
Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>“It is difficult for many people to adapt themselves to a
methodical plan of life long enough to establish a permanent
cure in consumption. I have known many a young fellow
with only a slight trouble in his lungs to die in the Adirondacks
more from the effects of whisky than from the disease
itself.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Henry P. Loomis</span>, of New York City, in a
Lecture on Consumption. (See page 232, of Handbook, on
the Prevention of Tuberculosis.)</p>

<p>“The majority of our patients receive no medication whatsoever.
The stomach is rarely in condition to bear excessive
medication, and the promiscuous use of creosote and similar
preparations is to be condemned. Milk and raw eggs are the
best articles of diet in addition to a regular diet of simple
food.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">James Alexander Miller</span>, M. D., of the Vanderbilt
Clinic, New York. (From Medical Record.)</p>

<p>“In my specialty, the treatment of pulmonary diseases, I
rarely prescribe alcohol in any form, and in the sanitaria with
which I have been connected it is the exception where alcohol
in any form is prescribed. I have advised against its use
where such has been the custom, believing that as a rule
alcoholic liquors do more harm than good in the treatment
of this disease.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prof. Vincent Y. Bowditch</span>, M. D., Harvard
Medical School, Boston.</p>

<p>“From personal experience in handling pulmonary tuberculosis,
not only at the Nordrach Ranch Sanitorium, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>past five years, but in an active practice of thirteen years, I
am more than convinced that whisky and liquor, in any form,
are absolutely poisonous to the consumptive.</p>

<p>“Whenever we admit a patient to the Nordrach Ranch Sanitorium,
we ascertain whether the individual is an alcoholic or
not; and we invariably find that such an individual is lacking
in vitality enough to combat the disease. They may look
fat and strong, pulmonary tuberculosis usually makes quick
work of them.</p>

<p>“It is also a noticeable fact, proven by various statistics,
that a very large percentage of alcoholics become tubercular;
and if we ever stamp out tuberculosis, we will also have to
stamp out intemperance.</p>

<p>“Trying to cure consumption with whisky is like trying to
put out a fire with kerosene. This is very easy to understand
when we stop to consider the nature of this disease.
In the first place, we have a very rapid heart’s action, dating
from the very earliest manifestations of the disease. The
pulse is often in excess of 100, even in incipient cases, and if
the stimulation of alcohol is added, we have what might be
called a ‘runaway heart’; and if there is one thing needed in
the long combat against tuberculosis, it is a good heart.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">John
E. White</span>, M. D., Medical Director Nordrach Ranch

<p>“You ask me my opinion as to the use of whisky in the
treatment of consumption. In reply permit me to say that I
regard its use in this disease as most universally pernicious.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prof.
Charles G. Stockton</span>, M. D., Buffalo Medical College,
Buffalo, N. Y.</p>

<p>“It was formerly thought that alcohol was in some way
antagonistic to tuberculous disease, but the observations of
late years indicate clearly that the reverse is the case, and
that chronic drinkers are more liable to both acute and pulmonary
tuberculosis. It is probably altogether a question of
altered tissue soil, the alcohol lowering the vitality and enabling
the bacilli more readily to develop and grow.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Osler</span>, formerly Professor of Medicine in Johns Hopkins
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>University, Baltimore, Md., now of Oxford University,
England.</p>

<p>“Upon investigation I found 38 per cent. of our male tubercular
patients were excessive users of alcohol, 56 per cent.
moderate users. From my study of the cases I am led to
believe that in a vast majority of these cases drink has been
a large factor in producing the disease, by exposure, lowering
of vitality, etc. I believe that alcohol has no place in
the treatment of tuberculosis. Many patients are deceived by
the false strength it gives them.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">O. C. Willhite</span>, M. D.,
Superintendent of Cook County Hospital for Consumptives,
Dunning, Ill.</p>

<p>“In tuberculosis there is a state of over-stimulation of the
circulatory system due to the toxins. The use of alcoholics
simply makes the condition worse. It reduces resistance and
makes the person more susceptible to the disease.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. J.
Blankmeyer</span>, M. D., Sanatorium Gabriels, in the Adirondacks,
N. Y.</p>

<p>“The practice of taking alcoholics of any sort, and in any
quantity, over a considerable length of time, is certain to produce
more or less injury to a tubercular patient, and their use
by tubercular people cannot be too strongly condemned.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">H.
S. Goodall</span>, M. D., Lake Kushaqua, N. Y.</p></div>

<p>Most of these opinions were written for the author
of this book in response to letters of inquiry. Are
they not indicative of a day when the medical profession
will lay aside alcoholic liquors in the treatment
of all diseases? It is acknowledged that the past usage
of giving whisky and cod-liver oil to consumptives was
an error; some day, it may be not far distant, a larger
acknowledgment may be made, and the medical use
of alcoholic liquors will be entirely a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Rev. J. M. Buckley, D.D., editor of <i>The Christian
Advocate</i>, was in early manhood considered an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>curable
consumptive. Being a man of great will
power and indomitable perseverance, he resolved to
try the open-air cure, together with the use of an
inspirator. The result was perfect restoration to
health, so that, as is well known, he can be easily
heard by audiences of thousands at Chautauqua
and other places where he is greatly in request for
lectures. He has written a pamphlet giving a full
history of his case. It can be obtained from Eaton
&amp; Mains, 150 Fifth Avenue, New York, for fifty
cents, and should be read by all consumptives who
have any “grit” in their composition.</p>

<p>Dr. Forrest, a hygienic physician, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“What is to be done if the germs have already obtained
lodgement in the lungs? Increase the general nutrition of the
body in every way, and then the lungs can resist the inroads of
the disease. The first thing necessary to improve the nutrition
of the body is to stimulate the digestive and absorbent functions
of the stomach and intestines. Naturally then, you must throw
the so-called cough medicines out of the window. The drugs
used to stop a cough are sedatives. Now, no sedative or nauseant
is known that does not lock up the natural secretions
and thus lessen the digestive powers. The cough is nature’s
method of expelling offending matter from the lungs and bronchial
tubes. It is infinitely better to have this stuff thrown out
of the lungs than retained there.”</p></div>

<p>Keep the bowels clean is this physician’s next
recommendation.</p>

<p>Sweet cream is preferable to cod-liver oil as it is
not so likely to derange the stomach. Easily di<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>gested
food is necessary, as the organs of digestion
are in weakened condition.</p>

<p>Again Dr. Forrest says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The consumptive should live as much as possible in the
open air.</p>

<p>“Dr. Trudeau inoculated twelve rabbits with tubercle or consumptive
germs. Six of these he turned loose on an island
where they ran wild. The other six were kept confined in
hutches such as rabbits are usually kept in. Results&mdash;All the
six rabbits in the open air recovered from the inoculation and
remained well. Five of the confined rabbits died of tubercles in
the lungs and different parts of the body. The sixth was still
lingering, badly diseased, when the experiment was brought to
a close. Fresh air and exercise enabled the first six to overcome
the disease germs. Confinement gave full play to the disease in
the others.</p>

<p>“Now, you house lovers, sleepers in close bedrooms, people
afraid of cold air, you are the rabbits in the hutches. Beware,
lest the verdict be in your case, ‘Died of tubercles in the
lungs.’ If you are not able to leave your home, live with open
windows, day and night, summer and winter.</p>

<p>“Exercise systematically, especially those exercises, accompanied
by deep breathing, that open and strengthen the lungs&mdash;exercises
without fatigue.</p>

<p>“If you are hoping that some wonderful, mysterious drug
has been or will be discovered, a drug that will cure consumption
without your help, you are hoping against hope. Improved
nutrition is your salvation, and that must come through exercise,
diet and fresh air.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg, in his <i>Home Hand-Book of
Hygiene and Medicine</i>, recommends a salt sponge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>bath upon retiring, to arrest night sweats, or sponging
with hot water. He adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is important that patients should know that the sweats
are greatly aggravated by opium in any form, and hence are increased
by cough mixtures of any sort which contain this drug.
Very simple remedies are often effective to relieve the most
distressing cough, such as gargling of water in the throat,
holding bits of ice in the mouth, taking occasional sips of
strong lemonade, and similar remedies. As a general rule,
patients run down and the disease progresses much more
rapidly, after beginning the use of opium in any form. Sometimes
it is best that the cough should be encouraged instead of
being repressed. When the patient expectorates very freely,
the cough is a necessary means of relieving the chest of matters
which would seriously interfere with the functions of the lungs
if retained, by filling up the bronchial tubes and air-cells. The
kind of cough needing relief is an irritable, ineffective cough,
unaccompanied by any considerable degree of expectoration.
Loaf sugar, honey or a mixture of honey and lemon juice, and
other simple, familiar remedies are often effective in relieving
such a cough. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“It is perhaps needless to add that the numerous quack
remedies for consumption advertised in the newspapers are
wholly without merit. There is no known drug which will cure
this disease, or in any certain degree influence its progress.
Numerous remedies have been recommended as curative, but
not one has thus far stood the test of experience.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Displacements of the Uterus</span>:&mdash;These conditions
are not among those for which alcoholic liquors are
likely to be advised by a physician, but women frequently
resort to Lydia Pinkham’s Compound and
other alcoholic preparations in the vain hope of finding
the relief so positively promised in the nostrum adver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>tisements.
Women are sometimes seriously injured by
using the nostrums specially advised for uterine weaknesses,
for this reason: a drug which may be of service
in an anæmic condition of the womb may do much
damage in an inflamed or engorged condition, yet
the nostrum vendors advise their preparations for all
alike, without a word of warning as to possible dangers.</p>

<p>Ordinary displacements may be recovered from by
cleanliness of the parts and by exercises which
strengthen the muscles in the pelvic region. The
writer has known a considerable number of women
who have been restored to health by exercises after
months, in some cases, and several years in others, of
weakness and misery. One of these women was a
close relative of a celebrated specialist in women’s
diseases. He said he could not do any more for her,
and gave permission for her to try the exercises, which
were given her by a well-equipped teacher of physical
training.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of displacements: anteversion,
retroversion, and prolapsus. The causes of these
troubles are various; lack of proper care in child-bearing,
miscarriages, heavy lifting, a hard fall, jumping
out of a carriage, straining, too violent exercise in gymnasium
work, and tight-lacing, also gradual weakening
of the ligaments which sustain the uterus in position.</p>

<p>An abdominal supporter should be worn constantly
during the day for a year or so, then left off gradually
an hour or two at a time. It should be worn during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>the second year whenever any extra work is to be
done.</p>

<p>There is a supporter sold by the Battle Creek Sanitarium
which is highly recommended, but any physician
can get one for a patient.</p>

<p>Perfect cleanliness is necessary. For this purpose
a hot vaginal douche should be taken two or three
times a day. This douche should be made astringent
by adding to a pint of water a quarter ounce of alum
or tannin. The hot astringent injections tone up the
lower supports of the uterus, and cleanse the passage.
The patient should remain in a recumbent position for
some hours after the douche if possible. Considerable
rest hastens a cure. Take the rest in the fresh air
when weather permits. Persistent use of sitz baths
will be found helpful.</p>

<p>For prolapsus the simplest form of internal supporter
is a small roll of cotton. After the organ is
carefully put into position this supporter should be
pressed up against the mouth of the womb, the patient
meanwhile lying upon her back. The ball of absorbent
cotton should be large enough to be retained in position,
and should be saturated with a weak solution of
glycerine and alum or glycerine and tannin before
being applied. A piece of white cord should be tied
firmly around the centre of this tampon by which it
may be removed. Remove before taking the douche.</p>

<p>Persons who feel unable to purchase an elastic or
other abdominal supporter can make a substitute (not
so good, but of considerable service) from unbleached
muslin made in the shape of the letter T, and having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>the cloth double. It should go up to the waist and be
made to fit over the hips, then should be fastened
firmly in front with safety-pins, and the cross-piece be
drawn up from the back and fastened securely in
front.</p>

<p>The daily exercises are the most important part of
the treatment. They must be begun gradually, and
taken at greater length as strength is gained. Those
for prolapsus will be given first:&mdash;</p>

<p>The patient should lie upon a rug, or on a firm
long sofa or couch. The feet should be drawn up as
close to the body as possible. Now lift the lower part
of the body so that the hips and lower portion of the
trunk will have no support but what comes from the
feet and shoulders. Hold this position for a minute
or two (longer when able without much fatigue).
After a few minutes’ rest repeat. This exercise may
be continued from twenty to thirty minutes, according
to patient’s strength. The elevation of the hips in this
exercise aids in the restoration of the organ to its
natural position. This exercise should be continued
daily, the number of times being increased as strength
increases.</p>

<p>A second exercise which is very helpful in prolapsus
is to support the body on the toes and elbows with the
face downward, and the hips raised as high as possible.
Another exercise may be taken with an assistant; the
patient should lie face downward, supporting the body
by the chest, and keeping the limbs rigid while the
assistant lifts the feet as high as possible without
hurting. These movements strengthen the abdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>inal
muscles and draw fresh blood to the weakened
parts, and cause quickened circulation in addition to
restoring the displaced organ to natural position. They
should be taken at night just before retiring after a
hot douche. The bowels should be kept open by the
free use of fruit. The patient should sleep with the
hips elevated as much as can be endured without
real discomfort and sit with the feet on a stool.
When strength sufficient is acquired the exercises for
anteversion will be found useful, and any other exercises
which strengthen the abdominal muscles, such
as bending backward and forward, and sideways.
Kneading and percussing the abdomen by an osteopath
or masseur strengthens, and also relieves constipation.
Rest during the day should be taken with the feet
higher than the head.</p>

<p>Prolapsus due to laceration in child-birth may require
a surgical operation.</p>

<p>In case of antiflexions the first exercise given for
prolapsus should be taken daily. (The advice for the
prolapsus treatment and the exercises are taken from
the writings of Dr. J. H. Kellogg, superintendent of
the Battle Creek Sanitarium.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anteversion</span>:&mdash;Persons suffering from anteversion
or retroversion should sleep without pillows under the
head, and lie flat upon the back; they should sit with
the feet as high as convenient and avoid high seats
which hinder the feet from touching the floor. They
should discard corsets and tight stocking supporters
which push or hold down the organs which need to be
replaced. Stocking supporters should be fastened over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>the hips and comfort waists can be bought in place
of corsets.</p>

<p>It is well to have an attendant to prepare weak
patients for first exercises in all uterine troubles by
the use of towels wrung from hot water applied to
the back and abdomen for a few minutes to relax
the muscles, or a hot water bottle, or hot salt bag may
be used. Then, with the patient lying with head low,
the attendant should give the abdomen and small of
the back a thorough rubbing or kneading for ten minutes
or less according to strength of patient. Olive oil
can be used on the hand in the rubbing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Exercise for Anteversion</span>:&mdash;Lie on bed or
rug; fold arms on chest; hold trunk of body still;
stretch legs, and hold the position about half a minute,
then relax at the knee and ankle. Then point the toes
down and stretch upper leg muscles; relax; then stretch
under leg muscles by stretching heel out. The patient
will feel the exercise as far as the shoulders, and
should be careful not to lift the body from the floor
at first. When patient can hold stretching exercise
for a minute then lift first the right, then the left leg,
and take same exercise until the person can give a
quick little kick for, say, twelve times, as the leg is
straightened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Exercise</span>:&mdash;Lying on the back, stretch to
full length; move the left leg out at the side, then up
and back to position, forming a semi-circle, keeping
muscles tense throughout. Then move right leg out at
the side&mdash;left&mdash;stretch toes long&mdash;relax&mdash;stretch heel&mdash;, lift
a little higher and bring back to place in a circle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>and rest. Same with left leg and then both together.
Few people can do this easily at first, the weight of
the legs is too much for the weak muscles at the back;
but some one can hold the foot at first. When the
patient can do this easily without bringing on any pain
or ache, she may sit in a low chair and take arm lifting
exercises.</p>

<p>Raise both arms out at the sides, then slowly raise
them up close to the head and consciously lift all the
organs of the body up, relax, and lower arms down
front and repeat slowly, six or ten times at first, until
for five minutes the patient can do this sitting. Then
take it standing for ten minutes or more. Stand with
feet wide apart. Dr. Anderson says, “A woman who
will do this twenty times each day can never have
anteversion, if she dresses properly, for it lifts the
organs in place each time.” It lifts the chest and
abdomen up, and brings a feeling of exhilaration if
done in the open air.</p>

<p>After the patient has taken exercises for five or six
weeks she may lie flat on the back, fold arms and raise
body up to sitting position without unfolding arms.
Then turn on right side and do the same, then on left
side and do the same. This is fine for back and abdomen
muscles.</p>

<p>Anteversion needs the Rest Cure, and resting with
the body in a position in which nature can right things
is an important thing to remember. Rest always after
exercise, either with a pillow under the knees or with
the legs hanging over a low foot-board, or lying on a
couch with the feet higher than the head. Exercise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>will relax the muscles and call for blood which will
revitalize and stimulate the weakened conditions. A
woman with this trouble should be careful about bending
quickly over, or climbing stairs, until she gains
strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Retroversion</span>:&mdash;Place the patient with face downward
on bed or mat and with a small pillow under the
lower part of the abdomen. Relax the muscles by
applying a hot towel, hot salt bag or hot water-bottle
just below the small of the back, and lower part of
the abdomen for ten or fifteen minutes. (Hot salt
bags are most effective and are easy to handle.) Then
rub the back briskly with a circular movement; if
tender in front, do not rub the abdomen. The circulation
will gradually carry away any inflammation as
soon as the muscles reach a normal condition, though
kneading of back and abdomen, using sweet oil on the
hand, is helpful if the patient can bear it.</p>

<p>The patient must remember that these conditions
have been months in coming and only painstaking
work and time can restore the weakened organs. The
manner of dress is very important; loose, comfortable
clothing must be worn. Sleep with the face down as
much as possible; nature will correct itself, if allowed,
many times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Exercise</span>:&mdash;Fold arms under forehead and
draw right knee up close to body and hold two minutes
(unless painful) and slowly straighten, and stretch
very slowly. Do the same with the left leg until the
patient can repeat the exercise twelve times with each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>leg and hold five minutes instead of two, with the knee
close to the body. It will probably take two weeks to
gain strength for this. After that time raise the body
up on hands, and move legs just as a baby does when
creeping, except that the patient only follows the movement
and does not move along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Exercise</span>:&mdash;Patient take sitting position on
floor and clasp hands under knees, and bring knees
up, so that chin and knees meet and hold. Then
straighten legs, slide hands toward the heels as far
as hands can reach, (stretch hands toward heels);
make a continuous movement of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Exercise</span>:&mdash;Sit on floor. Place the hands on
floor at sides, legs straight out in front, lift the body
from the floor with the arms, up and down. This is
a fine exercise for raising up the misplaced organs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Exercise</span>:&mdash;Place the patient flat on back
and push the body up to sitting position with hands
quite far back and palms down, recline again, up and
down until arms and back are very tired. Then sit
up, legs straight in front, raise the body from the
floor, (an inch) and move backward, resting weight
on hands, then move over on knees as at first exercise
and creep, then sit up and move backward again.
These will take a month to perfect. Begin by exercising
five minutes and gradually work up to half an
hour, rest between, always. The patient must have
the right mental attitude, must think that she is trying
to replace the uterus by lifting it to its natural
position. The exercises must not be lazily done.</p>

<p>Sitting in a tub of hot water is most helpful where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>there is much tenderness, or inflammation. Witch-hazel
in hot water douches or a weak solution of hot
salt water is a wonderful tonic in some cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exercise for Replacing Uterus to be Taken
Just Before Retiring</span>:&mdash;Kneel on the bed; bend forward
until the chest is touching the bed and the hips
are elevated as high as possible. The inlet of the
vagina should then be opened so as to admit air. As
soon as the air enters the womb falls into position. Lie
down at once and give nature a chance to regain
strength while you sleep.</p>

<p>The tampon soaked in glycerine and alum, and the
douches of hot water, in which a little alum is dissolved,
are both of great service in controlling the
flooding which so frequently accompanies change of
life and miscarriages. (Exercises for anteversion and
retroversion supplied by a successful teacher of such
work.)</p>

<p>The writer of this book asked a well-known medical
writer why physicians do not advise exercises for the
cure of displacements instead of operations. He said
it is because women are not willing to do anything to
help themselves. They expect the physician to cure
them, and the only way a physician can “cure” is to
operate. Sensible women, however, will be glad to
practice helpful exercises.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Debility</span>:&mdash;“The debility of convalescence requires fresh air,
easily digested food, the avoidance of over-exertion, with a
gradually increasing amount of exercise. Such debility is only
aggravated by alcohol, though it may for a time be partially
masked thereby. Milk, eggs, fresh fruit and farinaceous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>articles are the best foods. General debility without obvious
cause, may be treated by cold or tepid bathing. Salt added to
the bath is helpful. Change of air is a good tonic. Port wine
and other alcoholics while giving a false sensation of increased
vigor, really <i>reduce the tone of the pulse</i>, and therefore tend to
enfeeble the system. Alcohol is a relaxant, <i>not a tonic</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Depression of Spirits</span>:&mdash;“Learn the Delsarte exercise
for the ‘blues,’ and practice them daily. Hot air baths.
Avoid rich food. Take out-door exercise.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diarrhœa</span>:&mdash;“This is a symptom of the presence of an
irritant of which the stomach is trying to be rid. Do not arrest
it <a name="Page_172t" id="Page_172t"></a><a href="#Page_172tn">prematurely</a>, but assist it. If it persists, arrowroot, or corn
starch, or flour, mixed with cold water to the consistency of
cream may be taken, a tablespoonful at a time. 2. Bread
charcoal with cold milk. 3. A tablespoonful of cinnamon
water with a teaspoonful of lime water, mixed, every one, two
or three hours. Smaller dose for a child. Diet should be confined
to toast, milk toast, milk, cold or boiled. Tea, broth,
meat, etc., are sure to renew the trouble. Diarrhœa in infants
is generally due to errors in feeding, either over-feeding or the
use of improper kinds of food. Boiled milk thickened with
flour is a simple remedy in light cases. Alcoholics are
utterly unnecessary in diarrhœa, and to order them for young
children is quite wrong. A full enema of water, as hot as can
be borne, will remove offending substances from the bowels.</p>

<p>“Beware of diarrhœa medicines containing opium in any form.
They are unnecessary and dangerous, particularly for young
children.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dysentery</span>:&mdash;“At the beginning of the disease the stomach
should be relieved by the use of a large warm-water emetic.
The quantity of food should be restricted to the smallest
amount compatible with comfort. Ripe fruits, especially grapes,
and most stewed fruits, may be used in abundance to keep the
bowels regular. Salads, spices and other condiments, fats
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>and fried foods should be strictly avoided, together with tea,
coffee, alcoholics and all other narcotics.</p>

<p>“The diet should consist chiefly of simple soups, well boiled
oatmeal gruel, egg beaten with water or milk, and similar foods.
In many cases regulation of the diet is sufficient. Either the
hot or the cold enema may be employed.</p>

<p>“The use of opium, which is exceedingly common in this
disease, is not advisable, as it produces a feverish condition of
the system, decidedly prejudicial to recovery. Herroner, an
eminent German physician, very strongly discourages the use
of opium in this disease.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. H. Kellogg.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dyspepsia</span>:&mdash;“It is commonly supposed that a little good
whisky or brandy aids digestion, while on the contrary it has
been proved conclusively by observing the processes of digestion
upon persons who have fistula of the stomach, or by evacuating
the contents of the stomach by means of a stomach-pump
about an hour after taking a meal&mdash;in one instance after
taking an ounce of alcohol, and in another where no alcohol
was taken&mdash;that alcohol coagulates the albuminoids, throws
down the pepsin, decreases the acidity (the combined chlorin
and free hydrochloric acid), and increases the fixed chlorids.
Any one can make the observation upon himself, that a meal
taken without alcohol is more quickly followed by hunger than
one with it.</p>

<p>“Blumenau says: ‘On the whole, alcohol manifests a decidedly
unfavorable influence on the course of normal digestion
even when ingested in relatively small quantities, and impairs
the normal digestive functions.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Chittenden, professor of physiologic chemistry in Yale
College, as a result of some investigations made by himself and
Dr. Mendel, states in the <i>American Journal of Medical
Sciences</i>, that he finds that as small a quantity as three per
cent. of sherry, porter, or beer lessens the activity of the digestive
powers.”&mdash;<i>Bulletin of A. M. T. A.</i></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
<p>“It should be observed that doses of alcohol which have no
appreciable effect in delaying digestion, are so small as to be
practically useless for any beneficial action.”&mdash;<i>Medical Pioneer.</i></p></div>

<p>One doctor writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“What makes dyspepsia so hard to cure? This very
alcohol taking. The best cure is to refuse all alcoholic drinks,
at meals and all other times, and drink nothing but water.”</p></div>

<p>The causes of dyspepsia are various; errors of
diet being the most common. Others are mental
worry, care and anxiety, and the use of drugs.
An eminent writer upon this disease says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“My main object in the treatment is to prevent the sufferers
from resorting to drugs, which in such cases, not only produce
their own morbid conditions, but also confirm those already existing.</p>

<p>“The extensive and often habitual use of alkalies for acidity,
of purgatives for constipation, nervines and opiates for sleeplessness,
and after-dinner pills to goad into action the lagging
stomach, has been a potent factor in the production of a large
class of most inveterate dyspepsias.”</p></div>

<p>Underdone bread, cake, and pie, are unfit for any
stomach, yet are seen upon many tables. “Breakfast
foods,” cooked for ten or twenty minutes, are
also dyspepsia producers. All breads, cakes, pies
and cereals, require thorough cooking to fit them
for digestion. Most cereals are better for supper
than for breakfast, as they should be cooked in a
double boiler for several hours. A young man,
troubled with dyspepsia, learned to his amazement
that the oatmeal, which he supposed was his best
food, had much to do with the giddiness which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>often overcame him. He was advised to use dry
foods, such as toast, zwieback and shredded wheat.
This diet, together with the abandonment of nostrums,
led to a cure. Zwieback is bread sliced, and
dried in a moderate oven until light brown. Whole
wheat bread is best. It is very delicious and is
quite easily digested. In the case of the young
man, it is probable that the difficulty with the oatmeal
was the lack of sufficient cooking. Oatmeal
made into gruel, well cooked, and diluted with a
large quantity of scalded milk is easy of digestion.</p>

<p>Eating between meals, and excess in eating, lead
to stomach derangement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The best remedy for acidity of the stomach is hot-water
drinking. Two or three glasses should be taken as hot as can
be sipped, one hour before each meal, and half an hour before
going to bed. The effect of the hot water is to wash out the
stomach, and so remove any fermenting remains of the previous
meal. Heartburn may be treated the same as acidity.”</p></div>

<p>Persons troubled with slow digestion are better
to eat only two meals a day. The writer has personal
knowledge of a goodly number of women who
have been benefited wonderfully by adopting the
two meal a day plan.</p>

<p>Some persons, much troubled with dyspepsia,
have adopted the plan of prolonged fasting advocated
by Dr. Dewey, and testify to a cure by this
method. While heroic, it is certainly more rational
than drug treatment. For acute dyspepsia a fast
is requisite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>All that alcoholics can do for dyspepsia is to
allay the uneasy sensations for a time, while adding
to the trouble. It has been abundantly proved
that alcohol must pass from the stomach before
digestion can begin.</p>

<p>Dr. Ridge says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Many cases which seem to be relieved by the use of beer
are really benefited by the hop, or other bitter, which the ale or
beer contains. <i>Hop tea</i> is a useful stomachic, and a quarter of
a pint, or half that quantity, may be taken cold. It is made in
the same way as tea, using a handful of hops to a pint of boiling
water. Make fresh every day.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Kellogg says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In cases of chronic dyspepsia the use of alcohol seems to be
particularly deleterious, although not infrequently prescribed, if
not in the form of alcohol or ordinary alcoholic liquors, in the
form of some so-called ‘bitters,’ ‘elixir’ or ‘cordial.’ Nothing
could be further removed from the truth than the popular
notion that alcohol, at least in the form of certain wines, is
helpful to digestion. Roberts showed, years ago, that alcohol
even in small doses, diminishes the activity of the stomach in
the digestion of proteids. Gluzinski showed, ten years ago,
that alcohol causes an arrest in the secretion of pepsin, and
also of its action upon food. Wolff showed that the habitual
use of alcohol produces disorder of the stomach to such a degree
as to render it incapable of responding to the normal excitation
of the food. Hugounencq found that all wines, without
exception, prevent the action of pepsin upon proteids. The
most harmful are those which contain large quantities of alcohol,
cream of tartar or coloring matter. Wines often contain
coloring matters which at once completely arrest digestion, such
as methylin blue and fuchsin.</p>

<p>“A few years ago I made a series of experiments in which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>administered alcohol in various forms with a test meal, noting
the effect upon the stomach fluid as determined by the accurate
chemic examination of the method of Hayem and Winter.
The result of these experiments I reported at the 1893 meeting
of the American Medical Temperance Association. The subject
of experiment was a healthy young man whose stomach
was doing a slight excess of work, the amount of combined
chlorin being nearly fifty per cent. above normal, although the
amount of free hydrochloric acid was normal in quantity.
Four ounces of claret with the ordinary test meal reduced the
free hydrochloric acid from 28 milligrams per 100 c. c. of
stomach fluid to zero, and the combined chlorin from .270 to
.125. In the same case the administration of two ounces of
brandy with the ordinary test meal reduced the combined
chlorin to .035, scarcely more than one eighth of the original
amount, the free hydrochloric acid remaining at zero. Thus
it appears that four ounces of claret produced marked hypopepsia
in a case of moderate hyperpepsia, whereas two ounces
of brandy produced practically apepsia.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fainting or Syncope</span>:&mdash;The following letter
from the late Sir B. W. Richardson was addressed
to a lady who had sought the great physician’s
advice on the subject:&mdash;<br /></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="text-indent: 4em">
“25 Manchester Square, W., July 18, 1896.<br />
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>: There is no substance which acts as a
substitute for alcohol, nor is anything like it wanted. The
human body is a water engine, as I have often described it,
and alcohol plays no part in its natural motion. The idea
that when it begins to fail, a stimulant has to be called for,
springs merely from habit, and if, whenever any of the symptoms
of fainting you speak of occur, the person merely lies down on
the side or back and drinks a glass of hot water, or hot milk
and water, all that can be done is done. In the London
Temperance Hospital I have been treating the sick for diseases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>of all kinds and during all stages, and have never administered
a minim of alcohol, or any substitute for it, and we have got on
better than when I&mdash;feeling it at all times at command&mdash;made
use of it in the ordinary way.</p>

<br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment</span>:&mdash;“Lay the patient down in a current of air with
the feet raised higher than the head, preferably on one side in
case of sickness occurring, or bend the head down to the knees,
to restore the flow of blood to the brain. Loosen all clothing.
Rub the limbs, chest and over the heart with the hand or a
rough towel. Sprinkle cold water on the head and face. Smell
ammonia, strong vinegar, smelling salts or any pungent odor.
Put hot bottles to the feet, and in severe cases a mustard
plaster over the heart. Sip hot milk, hot water, hot tea, hot
black coffee, beef tea or a meat essence. Crowding round the
patient and all excitement should be avoided. In 999 cases out
of 1,000, no medicine is necessary.</p>

<p>“Faintness often proceeds from indigestion, flatulence inducing
pressure on the heart.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faintness, Weakness, Exhaustion, Fatigue</span>:&mdash;“The
truth is that for simple weakness, faintness, exhaustion, fatigue,
cold or wet, the best remedies are simple fresh air, pure water,
digestible food and rest. These are nature’s restoratives, and
the sooner both physicians and people learn to rely upon them
instead of upon drugs the better it will be for all parties. And
as the effect of alcoholic liquors are directly depressing to the
strength and activity of all the natural functions and processes
of life, as shown by the most varied and scientific investigations,
it is important that this fact be taught to both doctors and
people everywhere.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. N. S. Davis.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fits</span>:&mdash;“Whether the fit be apoplexy or epilepsy all alcoholics
are extremely bad, both at the time and afterwards. Alcohol,
the ‘genius of degeneration,’ is the chief cause of apoplexy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>and also a cause of epilepsy, especially when taken in the form
of beer. It diminishes the tone of the arteries and blood-vessels,
and thus tends to cause, aggravate and maintain a congested
state of the capillaries throughout the whole body. In the treatment
of epilepsy, therefore, neither alcohol nor any so-called
substitute should be given. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“In the convulsions of children alcohol is equally injurious.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Ridge.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flatulence</span>:&mdash;“Many uneasy sensations or pains, even in
distant parts of the body, are due to wind in the bowels, resulting
from indigestion. Asthma, cramps, depression of spirits,
faintness, giddiness, hiccough, prostration, sinking sensations
and sleeplessness, are all frequently due to the same cause.
The diet needs careful attention where there is much flatulence;
tea is often a cause. Charcoal biscuits are useful in some
cases; lemon juice in others. Fluid Magnesia may be taken.
Watch for the cause and remove it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Headache</span>:&mdash;<i>The New Hygiene</i> says: “This is the manifestation
of a deeper-seated trouble, usually in the stomach.
The use of stimulants is a sure promoter of headache. All
users of alcoholic liquors are, I believe, subject to headache,
and it is also a sure result of overindulgence in tea and coffee.</p>

<p>“To prevent the attacks, live regularly, avoid late hours and
excessive brain work; avoid tea, coffee and alcoholic beverages,
also sweets of all kinds, including sauces and pastries, and anything
fried in fat. Eat plenty of good, plain food, including
fruit, especially oranges. Eat none late at night. Exercise
regularly in such a way as to bring all the muscles into play,
at least once a day.</p>

<p>“To relieve an attack flush the colon.</p>

<p>“Headaches, which so largely result from the retention of
impure matter in the body, will be cured if a good quantity,
say two or three glasses, of hot water be drank in the morning
or at night, and then the next regular meal omitted, so that an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>interval of house-cleaning can be had before other material is
moved in.”&mdash;<i>Life and Health.</i></p>

<p>“Avoid pills and powders. Persons suffering from headache
need to be warned against taking remedies that contain opium
and alcohol, and also against the use of a recent popular
remedy, usually called a ‘white powder’ or ‘white tablet.’
They take the latter readily because the druggist or physician
says it contains no opium. This is true, but it is one of the
lately discovered coal tar preparations (anti-febrine, acetanilid,
etc.) and is very depressing to the human system. Headache
is usually a symptom of trouble somewhere else, often in the
alimentary canal, <a name="Page_180t" id="Page_180t"></a><a href="#Page_180tn">an</a> overloaded stomach, constipation, or
tight clothing. Learn the cause and remove that, and the
headache will disappear.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. H. J. Hall</span>, Franklin, Ind.</p>

<p>“Gentle massage is helpful and the use of cold compresses.
Lack of sufficient sleep will cause headache. Women often
bring on nervous headache by overwork and worry.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hemorrhage</span>:&mdash;“Never give alcohol in a case of profuse
hemorrhage. The faint feeling, or irresistible inclination to lie
down is nature’s own method of circumventing the danger, by
quieting the circulation and lessening the expulsive force of the
heart, thus favoring the formation of clot at the site of the
injury.”&mdash;<i>Clinique.</i></p>

<p>“For uterine hemorrhage an emetic to induce vomiting is
the best cure.”&mdash;Dr. Higginbotham in <i>British Medical Journal</i>.</p>

<p>“If the faint is dispelled too quickly, and the blood-vessels
are relaxed by alcohol, or the heart aroused to energetic action
by any remedy, the hemorrhage may recommence, and may
prove fatal. Quiet, the application of cold, pressure, the elevation
of the wound where possible, and the absence of stimulants,
are the cardinal points of treatment in most cases.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Ridge.</span></p>

<p>“If then, it seems absolutely necessary to rouse a person out
of a dead faint, what can be done? Swallowing is out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>question, lest the patient choke. The head must be laid low,
and the face and chest flapped with a cold wet cloth, or alternately
with hot wet cloths; smelling salts (not too strong) may
be applied to the nose.</p>

<p>“When the faint has been recovered from, but the hemorrhage
continues so much that it is feared another faint may
occur, and, perhaps, be fatal, it may be warded off by drinking
any hot liquid; if Liebig’s extract of meat, or strong beef tea, is
at hand and can be given hot, there is nothing better.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heart Disease</span>:&mdash;Dr. Ridge says: “I trench here on a
delicate subject, because, when there is real disease of the
heart, medical advice will of course have been obtained, and
very probably a doctor may have said that some alcoholic liquor
is essential. There are, also, several different forms of heart
disease which require altogether different treatment, and only a
physician can tell the difference, or appreciate the necessity for
the particular treatment required. But it may be pointed out
that alcohol is utterly unable to ‘strengthen’ the heart, or give
tone to the blood-vessels, or to the system at large.</p>

<p>“The alteration in the pulse due to alcohol is chiefly owing
to its paralyzing action on the blood-vessels, and when they are
too contracted, and thereby cause the weakened heart to labor
too much, the alcohol will give relief for the time. But we
have in nitrite of amyl, a fluid which will act more quickly and
more powerfully; but this must not be employed without medical
direction. It is very useful in cases of <i>angina pectoris</i>, or
<i>breast pang</i>, but is rarely required in the majority of cases in
which the valves of the heart are diseased. The paralyzing
action of alcohol is not generally produced by less than half a
wine-glassful of brandy or whisky, or twice that quantity of
wine, and often much more is required. The relief to uneasy
sensations which much smaller quantities sometimes produce is
due to their anæsthetic or benumbing action, by which the
nerves of the patient are rendered less sensible, although the
danger is by no means diminished. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>“The only sensible way to avert the evil consequences of
heart disease is to strengthen the heart, and that is to be done
by strengthening the body generally. The amount of exercise,
the kind of baths, etc., which should be taken, have to be modified
in accordance with the nature of the case. If these natural
health-giving measures cannot be employed nothing is an
effectual substitute.</p>

<p>“<i>Weak</i> or <i>feeble heart</i> is a common complaint, and is as
ordinary an excuse for resorting to alcoholic liquors as ‘Timothy’s
stomach.’ If there is no organic disease; if the valves
of the heart are healthy and act properly, all anxiety on this
point may be entirely banished. The slow pulse, the feeble
pulse, the cold feet, the want of energy, these are not to be got
rid of by such a mere temporary agent as alcohol, even if relief
can be thus obtained from day to day. The constant application
of alcohol to the tissues of the body alters them gradually
by its chemical action. In addition to this, the balance of the
nervous system is altered, an unnatural condition is produced,
and the unhappy patient becomes more liable to disease and
more easily succumbs when attacked.</p>

<p>“Many of these ‘feeble hearts’ mean too little exercise, very
often also, too much or improper food and drink.</p>

<p>“The best remedies are cold sponging (according to the
season); avoidance of coddling; plain, wholesome food; abstinence
from tea, hot drinks and condiments; regular out-of-doors
exercise and all similar true <i>tonic</i> measures.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Kellogg says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Persons subject to attacks of <i>angina pectoris</i> should carry
with them a small bottle containing a sponge saturated with
nitrite of amyl, and place it to the nose when necessary.</p>

<p>“Sympathetic palpitation may be relieved by bending the
head downward, allowing the arms to hang down. The effect
of this measure is increased by holding the breath a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>seconds while bending over. Another ready means of relief is
to press strongly upon the large arteries on either side of the
neck.</p>

<p>“Palpitation of the heart is often mistaken for real organic
disease of the organ. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A careful regulation of the
diet is in most cases all that is necessary to effect a cure.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Edmunds, of London, was asked during a
medical discussion what he thought of the use of
alcohol in heart disease. His answer is embodied
in the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“With regard to the use of brandy in cases of heart disease,
he was convinced it was a mistake to use it in such cases.
There were many forms of heart disease, but the most common
kind arose from the heart being too fat. Excess of fat debilitated
the heart and injured its working, just as a piece of wax
attached to a tuning fork would impair its usefulness. In such
cases he dieted his patients in order to reduce their weight.
Every dose of brandy taken for heart disease increased the
evil. The moment brandy was taken for heart disease, or any
other chronic complaint of a similar kind, the disease was
increased. If doctors recommended alcohol to their patients,
he had been asked what abstainers should do. In such cases,
as had been suggested, he thought the patients might ask what
the alcohol was to do for them, and if the reply was not
satisfactory, they should get another doctor.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Hartford, Conn., has deduced
some valuable facts from his experiments
with the sphygmograph, upon the action of the
heart. He has found by repeated experiments that
while alcohol apparently increases the force and
volume of the heart’s action, the irregular tracings
of the sphygmograph show that the real vital force
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>is diminished, and hence its apparent stimulating
power is deceptive.</p>

<p>Dr. C. W. Chapman, of the National Hospital for
Diseases of the Heart, wrote in the <i>Lancet</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The very thing (alcohol) which they supposed had kept
their heart going was responsible for many of its difficulties.”</p></div>

<p>Of cases of palpitation and irregularity caused by
business anxieties or indigestion, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“To give alcohol is only to add fuel to the fire.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heart Failure</span>:&mdash;“In cases of cardiac weakness, the
thing needed is not simply an increased rate of movement of
the heart, or an increased volume of the pulse, but an increased
movement of the blood current throughout the entire system.
In the application of any agent for the purpose of affording
relief in a condition of this kind, the peripheral heart as well as
the central organ must be taken into consideration. In fact,
the whole circulatory system must be regarded as one. The
heart and the arteries are composed of essentially the same
kind of tissue, and have practically the same functions. The
arteries as well as the heart are capable of contracting.</p>

<p>“Both the heart and the arteries are controlled by excitory
and inhibitory nerves. These two classes of nerves are kindred
in structure and in origin, the vagus and the vasodilators being
medullated, while the accelerators of the heart and the vasoconstrictors
of the arteries are non-medullated and pass
through the sympathetic ganglia on the way to their distribution.</p>

<p>“Winternitz and other therapeutists have frequently called
attention to the value of cold as a cardiac stimulant or tonic.
The tonic effect of this agent is greater than that of any
medicinal agent which can be administered. The cold compress
applied over the cardiac area of the chest may well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>replace alcohol as a heart tonic. The thing necessary to
encourage the heart’s action is not merely relaxation of the
peripheral vessels, but, as Winternitz has shown, increased
activity of the peripheral circulation in the skin, muscles and
elsewhere. Alcohol paralyzes the vasoconstrictors, and so
dilates the small vessels and lessens the resistance of the heart
action; but at the same time it lessens the activity of the
nerve centres which control the heart, diminishes the power of
the heart muscle, and lessens that rhythmical activity of the
small vessels whereby the circulation is so efficiently aided at
that portion of the blood circuit most remote from the heart.
A continuous cold application applied to that portion of the
chest overlying the heart stimulates the nerves controlling the
walls of the vessels, and at the same time energizes the corresponding
cardiac nerves. It is wise to remember that the
vasoconstrictor nerves are one in kind with the excitor nerves
of the heart, while the vasodilators are in like manner associated
with the vagus. With this in mind, it is clear that while
alcohol paralyzes the vasoconstrictors, it at the same time
weakens the nerves which initiate and maintain the activity of
the heart; while, on the other hand, cold excites to activity
those nerves which produce the opposite effect.</p>

<p>“The apparent increase of strength which follows the administration
of alcohol in cases of cardiac weakness is delusive.
There is increased volume of the pulse for the reason that the
small arteries and capillaries are dilated, but this apparent improvement
in cardiac action is very evanescent. This is a
natural result of the fact that while the heart is relieved momentarily
by sudden dilation of the peripheral vessels, the accumulation
of the blood in the venous system, through the loss
of the normal activity of the peripheral heart, gradually raises
the resistance by increasing the amount of blood which has to
be pushed along in the venous system. This loss of the action
of the peripheral heart more than counterbalances the temporary
relief secured by the paralysis of the vasoconstrictors.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>“Thermic applications, general and local, may safely be affirmed
to be the true physiological heart tonic. In the employment
of the cold pericardial compress as a heart tonic, the
application should generally be continued not more than half
an hour at a time, and its use may be alternated with general
cold applications to the surface. A cold towel rub, or the cold
trunk pack is the best form for application if the patient is very
feeble.</p>

<p>“The cold towel rub is applied thus: wring a towel as dry
as possible out of very cold water, and spread it quickly and
evenly over the surface; rub vigorously outside until the skin
begins to feel warm; then remove, dry the moistened surface,
rub until it glows, and make the same application to another
part; and so on until the whole surface of the body has been
gone over. The procedure should be rapid and vigorous.</p>

<p>“If the cold trunk pack is employed, a sheet of not more
than one thickness should be wrung as dry as possible out of
very cold water, and wrapped quickly about the body, after
first dipping the hands in water, and rubbing the trunk vigorously.
In cases of extreme cardiac weakness, very cold and
very hot applications may be alternately applied over the region
of the heart. The duration of the hot and cold applications
should be about fifteen seconds each.</p>

<p>“Any one who has ever witnessed the marvelous effects of
applications of this sort in reviving a flagging heart will never
doubt their efficacy, and will have no occasion to resort to
alcohol, or any other intoxicant, to stimulate a flagging heart.
The writer has employed these measures for stimulating the
heart for more than twenty years, and might cite hundreds
of instances in which their efficiency has been demonstrated.
They are applicable not only to the cardiac depression encountered
in the adynamic stage of typhoid and other fevers,
but in cases of heart failure from hemorrhage, of surgical
shock, collapse under chloroform or ether, opium poisoning,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>coal gas asphyxia, drowning, etc.”&mdash;Dr. J. H. Kellogg, in
<i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i>, Jan., 1899.</p></div>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis tells of a case of threatened collapse
where he was called in consultation. Patient
was in a small, unventilated room.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It was easy to see that what she needed was fresh air
in her lungs. Instead of giving alcohol in any form she
was moved into a large, well-ventilated room. All symptoms
of ‘heart failure’ disappeared. Had she begun to take
whisky or brandy, physician and friends would have attributed
her recovery to that, when in fact it would have retarded recovery
by hindering oxygenation of the blood.”</p>

<p>“It would also be a very great mistake to suppose that when
reaction follows collapse, in cases in which alcohol has been
given, this result is always due to the alcohol. I have seen so
many cases of severe collapse recover without alcohol that I
cannot but be skeptical as to its necessity, and even as to its
value. I was much struck many years ago by a case of post
partum hemorrhage which was so severe that convulsions set
in. I should then have given brandy if there had been any to
give, but there was none in the house and none to be got. I
administered teaspoonfuls of hot water and the patient revived
and recovered; next day, except for anæmia, she was as well
as ever, with no reactionary fever or other disturbance, as would
almost certainly have been the case if brandy had been given.</p>

<p>“In collapse from hemorrhage, we have learned the value of
injections of warm saline water, either into the veins, the skin
or the rectum, and the same treatment is available in other
cases of collapse with contracted vessels.</p>

<p>“Another measure which has proved most efficacious is the
<i>inhalation of oxygen</i> gas. This is especially useful in cases in
which alcohol is decidedly injurious, namely, those in which
there is increasing congestion of the lungs, which the heart,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>though doing its utmost, is unable to overcome. Alcohol only
increases the congestion, and the heart is already over-exerted
and nearly exhausted. The effect of the oxygen is apparent in
a few seconds, and cases have been rescued in which death appeared
to be inevitable and imminent.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Ridge.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heart Stimulants</span>:&mdash;“The advantage of beef extract
over alcohol as a stimulant was demonstrated on a large scale
in the Ashantee war.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Ridge</span>, London.</p></div>

<p>For those who must have a drug: aqua ammonia,
8 drops to ½ cup of hot water, or 20 grains carbonate
ammonia to ½ cup water. Hot water alone is a
useful stimulant; also water, hot or cold, with a few
grains of Cayenne pepper added. The latter is
good, not only to start the heart’s action in collapse,
but also to relieve violent pain. Hot milk is a most
valuable stimulant. Many persons to whom hot
milk has been given during the extreme weakness
of acute disease have testified afterward to its good
effects in comparison with the wine formerly administered.
The wine caused an after-feeling of chilliness
and weakness, while the milk gave warmth and
added strength.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Insomnia or Sleeplessness</span>:&mdash;“A person who suffers
from sleeplessness should avoid the use of tea and coffee,
tobacco, alcoholic liquors and all other disturbers of the nervous
system. Eating immediately before retiring has been recommended,
but the ultimate result may be an aggravation of
the difficulty instead of relief. If a person suffers from ‘all
gone feelings’ so that he cannot sleep, he should take a few
sips of cold water or a glass of lemonade. As complete relief
will generally be obtained as from eating, and the stomach will
be saved work when it should be resting. A warm bath just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>before retiring, a wet-hand rub, a cool sponge bath, gentle
rubbing of the body with the dry hand, a moist bandage worn
about the abdomen during the night, are all useful measures.
When the feet are cold, they should be thoroughly warmed by
a hot foot or leg bath, and thorough rubbing. When the head
is congested, these measures should be supplemented by the
application of cold to the head, as the cold compress or the
ice-cap.”</p></div>

<p>A walk in the evening, or gentle calisthenics, may
help those of sedentary habits. Bicycle riding and
horse-back riding in the evening have helped many.</p>

<p>The practice of long deep breathing will often put
persons to sleep when all other devices fail. The
lungs should be filled to their utmost capacity, and
then emptied with equal slowness, repeating the
respiration about ten times a minute, instead of
eighteen or twenty, the natural rate. Those who
fall asleep upon first going to bed, and after a few
hours awake, and are unable to sleep again, may
find relief by getting out of bed, and rubbing the
surface of the body with the dry hand. Or walk
about the room a few minutes, exposing the skin to
the air, go back to bed and try the deep breathing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The use of drugs for the purpose of inducing sleep should
be avoided as much as possible. Opium is especially harmful.
Sleep obtained by the use of opiates is not a substitute for
natural sleep. The condition is one of insensibility, but not of
natural refreshing recuperation. Three or four hours of natural
sleep will be more than equivalent to double that amount of
sleep obtained by the use of narcotics. When a person once
becomes dependent upon drugs of any kind for producing
sleep, it is almost impossible for him to dispense with them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>It is often dangerous to resort to their temporary use, on
account of the great tendency to the formation of the habit of
continuous use. The use of opiates for securing sleep is one of
the most prolific means by which the great army of opium-eaters
is annually recruited. Chloral, bromide of potash,
whisky and other drugs are to be condemned almost as
strongly as opium.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Kellogg.</span></p></div>

<p>Dr. Furer, of Heidelberg, Germany, in a paper
before the International Congress against alcohol,
held in Basle, Switzerland, in Sept., 1895, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The sleep from alcohol does not act as a mental tonic, but
leaves the mind weaker next day.”</p></div>

<p>Some noble specimens of manhood have become
wrecks through accepting the advice to try “whisky
night-caps.” Edison recommends manual labor,
instead of going to rest, for aggravated insomnia.
He says sleep will soon come naturally.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">La Grippe</span>:&mdash;“Alcohol has no place in the treatment of <i>la
grippe</i>; on the contrary it is because of the too frequent use
of this, and other narcotics, that epidemics make such fearful
headway in our land, and such must be the rule until the
people study the laws of health and obey them. Profuse
sweating, followed by a careful bathing of the body in tepid
water, gradually cooling it to a normal temperature, and avoiding
unnecessary exposure, will relieve. The patient should
sleep in pure air and eat as little as possible, and that only
when hungry. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Quinine is essentially a nerve poison,
and capable of producing a profound disturbance of the nervous
centres. A drug of such potency for evil should be employed
with the greatest care, and never when a milder agency will
secure the result. Exceedingly pernicious is the habit of dosing
children with this drug.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Charles H. Shepard</span>, Brooklyn,
N. Y.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>“A late surgeon of the gold coast of Africa wrote the following
to the London <i>Lancet</i> of Jan. 2, 1890: ‘Some of the worst
cases of this disease, the grippe, remind me of an epidemic I
saw among the natives of the swamps of the Niger. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Irrespective of disinfectants and inhalations there is a simple,
effective and ready remedy, the juice of oranges in large quantities,
not of two or three, but of dozens. The first unpleasant
symptoms disappear, and the acid citrate of potash of the juice,
by a simple chemic action decreases the amount of fibrine in the
blood to an extent which prevents the development of pneumonia.’”</p></div>

<p>The Syracuse (N. Y.) <i>Post-Standard</i> contained
the following during the epidemic of 1899:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Dr. George D. Whedon declared to a <i>Post-Standard</i> reporter
yesterday that there is practically no subsiding of the grippe
in this city. Dr. Whedon said that the weather conditions
have little, if anything, to do with the disease, and that it is impossible
to define the conditions which produce it. It is
some morbific agency, the influence of which, Dr. Whedon
said, is exerted upon the pneumogastric nerve.</p>

<p>“<i>Dr. Whedon was emphatic in denouncing treatment by
means of alcoholic stimulants, and coal tar derivatives.</i> In discussing
the subject at some length he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I find that infants and young children are practically
exempt from the disease, and the liability increases with age. In
my own experience, which has since 1889 amounted to an
aggregate of 3,000 cases, alcoholic stimulants have appeared to
be usually of little or no value; their usual stimulating effect
does not seem to be realized in this condition. Unless malarial
complications exist quinine appears of no benefit, and then
should not be used in larger than two grain doses. Large
doses depress the weakened heart, and in all cases increase the
terrible confusion and headache constantly present in severe
cases.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>
<p>‘From the views I entertain of its pathology, and from the
terrible fatality which has attended the extensive use of the
coal tar derivatives in treatment of <i>la grippe</i>, I argue that the
manner in which they have been prescribed in the beginning of
the disease, to reduce fever, and relieve the often intense suffering,
lowers the heart’s action, which is already sufficiently incapacitated
by the toxic agent producing the disease.</p>

<p>‘The intention is usually to stimulate later, but later is in
many cases unfortunately too late. The heart being overwhelmed
by the poison, and by the added depression of all coal
tar preparations, cannot keep up the pulmonary circulation.
The swelling of the lungs increases, and the result is fatal.</p>

<p>‘I am aware of the weight of authority for their administration
and of the relief they afford, but am just as well assured that
were their use discontinued, the greatly increased death-rate from
<i>la grippe</i> would cease to appear.</p>

<p>‘These coal tar remedies are being used everywhere, and
the medical journals recommend them despite the fatal results.
They are being used every hour in the day in Syracuse, and, as
a result, are knocking out good people. Among the most popular
coal tar derivatives I might mention anti-kamnia, salol-phenacetine,
anti-pyrine and salicylate of soda.</p>

<p>‘Prognosis is favorable at all ages. Patients should be kept
warm, and perfectly quiet in bed, and supplied with such nutritious
and easily digested food, at frequent intervals, as the partially
paralyzed stomach can take care of. All nourishment
must be fluid and warm rather than cold.’”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Journal of Inebriety</i> for April, 1889, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The present epidemic of influenza has proved to be very
fatal in cases of moderate and excessive alcoholic drinkers.</p>

<p>“Pneumonia is the most common sequel, breaking out suddenly,
and terminating fatally in a few days. Heart failure
and profound exhaustion, is another fatal termination. One case
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>was reported to me of an inebriate, who, after a full outbreak
of all the usual symptoms, drank freely of whisky and became
stupid and died. It was uncertain whether cerebral hemorrhage
had taken place, or the narcotism of the alcohol had combined
with the disease and caused death.</p>

<p>“A physician appeared to have unusual fatality in the cases
of this class under his care.</p>

<p>“It was found that he gave some form of alcohol freely, on
the old theory of stimulation. Another physician gave all
drinking cases with this disease alcohol, on the same theory,
and had equally fatal results. It has been asserted that alcohol,
as an antiseptic, was useful in these bacterial epidemics, but its
use has been followed by greater depression, and many new
and complex symptoms. The frequent half domestic and
professional remedy, hot rum and whisky, has been followed
by more serious symptoms, and a protracted convalescence.
Many facts have been reported showing the danger of alcohol
as a remedy, also the fatality in cases of inebriates who were
affected with this disease.</p>

<p>“The first most common symptom seems to be heart exhaustion
and feebleness, then from the catarrhal and bronchial irritation,
pneumonia often follows.”</p></div>

<p>The vapor or Turkish bath is the best means of
“breaking up” this disease, together with hot
lemonade and rest in bed for a day or two. The
inhalation of hot steam should be tried when there
is much bronchial irritation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Life-Saving Stations, The Use of Alcohol In</span>:&mdash;“There
is no possible useful place for alcoholic liquors in connection
with a life-saving station. Applied externally the rapid
evaporation of alcohol reduces the temperature; taken internally
it diminishes the efficiency of both respiration and circulation,
and by increasing congestion of the kidneys it directly increases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>the danger of secondary bad effects from exposures of any kind.
To restore warmth and circulation to the surface, light, rapid
friction and the wrapping with dry flannel is the safest, cheapest
and most efficient, while free breathing of fresh air, and frequent
small doses of milk, beef-tea, ordinary tea or coffee, or
even simple water, will afford the greatest amount of strength
and endurance, and leave the least secondary bad consequences.
It is just as easy to keep at hand a jug or flask of any one of
the articles named as it is to keep a flask of whisky or brandy.
There is no need of keeping them hot, as they act well at any
temperature at which they can be drunk.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. N. S. Davis</span>,
Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Measles</span>:&mdash;“In mild cases, very little treatment is required,
except such as is necessary to make the patient comfortable.
Good nursing is much more important than medical attendance.
If the eruption is slow in making its appearance, or is repelled
after having appeared, the patient should be given a warm
blanket pack.</p>

<p>“The old-fashioned plan of keeping the patient smothered
beneath heavy blankets, and constantly in a state of perspiration
is wholly unnecessary. The irritation of the skin, as well
as the sensitiveness to cold, may be relieved by rubbing the
skin gently two or three times a day with vaseline or sweet oil.
There is no danger from the application of cold water to the
surface except in the last stages of the disease, after the eruption
has disappeared.</p>

<p>“The patient should be allowed cooling drinks as much as desired.
During the disease a simple but nutritious diet should be
allowed, but <i>stimulants of all kinds should be prohibited</i>.”</p>

<p>“It is wholly unnecessary, and dangerous as well, to give
whisky to bring out the eruption.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. I. N. Quimby</span>, Jersey
City.</p>

<p>“Any hot drink, such as ginger tea or hot lemonade, may
be used to hasten the eruption, if delayed.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malaria</span>:&mdash;Observers of this disease in such regions
as the gold coast of Africa have noted the
fact that malarial attacks are generally preceded by
impaired digestion. The disease is said to be due
to animal parasites. These parasites are supposed
to generate in the soil of certain regions, and thence,
through the drinking water, or otherwise, find entrance
to the human body.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A healthy stomach is able to destroy germs of all sorts,
hence the best protection from malaria is the boiling of all
drinking water, and the maintenance of sound digestion and
purity of blood by an aseptic dietary.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg says in <i>The Voice</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It must be understood, however, that fruit in malarial regions,
especially watermelons, may be thickly covered with
malarial parasites and the parasites may sometimes find entrance
to the fruit when it becomes over-ripe, so that the skin
is broken. It is evident, then, that care must be taken to disinfect
such fruit by thorough washing, or by dipping in hot
water, which is the safer plan. The same remark applies to
cucumbers, lettuce, celery, cabbage and other green vegetables
which are commonly served without cooking. Not only malarial
parasites but small insects of various kinds are often
found clinging to such food substances, their development being
encouraged by the free use of top dressing on the soil, a process
common with market gardeners.</p>

<p>“The treatment of malarial disease is too large and intricate
a subject for proper treatment in these columns. We will say
briefly, however, at the risk of being considered very unorthodox,
that the majority of cases of malarial poisoning can be cured
without the use of drugs of any sort. In fact, in the most
obstinate cases of chronic malarial poisoning, drugs are of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>almost no use whatever. Quinine, however, is certainly of
value as a curative agent in these cases, either in destroying
the parasites, or in preventing their development; but as it does
not remove the cause, its curative effect is likely to be very
transient. The practice of habitually taking quinine as a preventive
of malarial disease is a most injurious one, as quinine
is itself a non-usable substance in the system, and therefore
must be looked upon as a mild poison, to be dealt with by the
liver and kidneys the same as other poisons. By habitual use
it may itself become a cause of disease. One or two periodical
doses of quinine often prove of great service in interrupting the
paroxysms of an intermittent fever, but other treatment must
also be employed to develop the bodily resistance, and fortify the
system against disease. The morning cold bath, followed by
vigorous rubbing, is a most excellent measure for this purpose,
but the old-fashioned German wet-sheet pack is one of the best
remedies known. The paroxysm itself can generally be
avoided by means of the dry pack, begun before the chill
makes its appearance; but this requires the services of an expert
nurse. In not a few cases it is wise for a person who
suffers frequently from malarial disease to seek a change of
climate to some non-malarial region.</p>

<p>“Col. T. W. Higginson of the First South Carolina Volunteers,
in 1862, said of Dr. Seth Rogers, an eminent Southern physician,
who was surgeon of the regiment: ‘Fortunately for us, he
was one of that minority of army surgeons who did not believe
in whisky, so that we never had it issued in the regiment while
he was with us, and got on better, in a highly malarial district,
than those regiments which used it.’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maternity</span>:&mdash;Dr. Ridge says:&mdash;“It is one of the greatest
mistakes to make use of alcoholic beverages to ‘keep up the
strength’ during labor. It is, of course, impossible to predict
at the commencement how long the labor will last; if then
brandy, or other similar drink, is resorted to early, it acts most
injuriously. The desire for food is often entirely removed; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>demand of the system being therefore unperceived, and so not
supplied, a state of weakness and prostration is in time produced,
if the labor should be protracted, which may be really
serious. The nervous system becomes exhausted by the repeated
action of the alcohol. If a fatal result is not occasioned,
yet the prostration of body and mind after delivery is aggravated,
and convalescence thereby retarded. Alcoholic drinks
produce paralysis and congestion of the blood-vessels, and in
this way largely increase the liability to flooding after the labor
is over. Alcohol also increases the liability to a feverish
condition.</p>

<p>“It is necessary to take small quantities of plain, nourishing
food at regular intervals, and nothing is of greater value than
well-cooked oatmeal: other farinaceous food may be substituted,
if preferred. If there is much prostration, meat extracts
or beef tea are of great value. Tea tends to produce flatulence
and to prevent sleep.</p>

<p>“After the labor is over, the best restorative is a cup of hot
beef tea or an egg beaten up in warm milk or a cup of warm
gruel. Rest, and absence of excitement and worry are essential
and alcohol is specially injurious.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Menstruation, Painful</span>:&mdash;Young girls often
resort to the use of brandy during the monthly
period, and parents ask anxiously, “What can they
use instead of the brandy?”</p>

<p>The very best thing that can be done is to go to
bed, wrapped in flannels, with a hot-water bottle or
other hot application to the abdomen, and to the
feet. Take hot ginger tea, or pepper tea.</p>

<p>A warm hip-bath taken at the beginning may give
relief, or a large hot enema retained for half an hour
or so. Rest is necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>For those who must go to work, Dr. Ridge
recommends five drops of oil of juniper, to be
taken on sugar.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Neuralgia</span>:&mdash;“The principal cause of neuralgia is defective
nutrition of the nerves. Disorders of digestion are very often
accompanied by neuralgia in various parts of the body. It
may also result from taking cold, from loss of sleep, from dissipation,
and also from the use of tobacco, alcohol, tea and
coffee.</p>

<p>“The patient’s general health must be improved by a wholesome,
simple diet, and the employment of tonic baths, as a
daily sponge bath, and massage in feeble cases. Sun-baths
and exercise in the open air are of first importance. Ordinary
neuralgia may almost always be relieved by either moist or dry
heat. In some cases, cold applications give more relief than
hot. As a rule, abnormal heat requires cold, and unnatural
cold requires hot applications. In many cases it is necessary
to give the patient a warm bath of some kind. Electricity
often succeeds when all other remedies fail.</p>

<p>“For facial neuralgia apply hot fomentations, together with
the use of sitz baths, or hot foot baths. The head may be
steamed by holding it over hot water, adding pieces of hot
brick occasionally to keep water steaming, head being covered.</p>

<p>“There is no complaint, perhaps, in the treatment of which
the use of port wine will be more strongly urged by kind
friends, with the assurance that it is impossible to get well
without it. This is quite untrue, as thousands can testify.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Ridge.</span></p>

<p>“Avoid opiates of all sorts. ‘It is better to bear the ills we
have than fly to others that we know not of.’ The pangs of
neuralgia are as nothing to endure compared with the sufferings
of an opium wreck. Build up the general health, and the neuralgia
will disappear.”</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nausea.</span>&mdash;“A feeling of sickness is not uncommonly due to
indigestion. If it is caused by rich food take a pinch of bicarbonate
of soda in a little water, or a teaspoonful of fluid magnesia.
The acidity of the food will thus be neutralized, and
this course is far preferable to benumbing the stomach with
brandy. If indigestion is the cause, it is often salutary to miss
one or two meals, so as to allow the stomach to recover.</p>

<p>“When due to pregnancy, a little aërated water, or soda
water is useful; sometimes a small wafer or a crust, eaten before
rising in the morning, will check it. An early morning
walk, if the weather is pleasant, is helpful.</p>

<p>“The moist abdominal bandage is a very excellent means of
relieving nausea during pregnancy. It should be worn constantly
for a week or two, and then omitted during the night.
Daily sitz baths are also of great advantage. In many cases
electricity relieves this symptom very promptly. In very urgent
cases in which the vomiting cannot be repressed, and the life of
the patient is threatened, the stomach should be given entire
rest, the patient being nourished by nutritive injections. Fomentations
over the stomach, and swallowing small bits of ice,
are sometimes effective when other measures fail.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. H.
Kellogg.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Outgrowing the Strength</span>:&mdash;“There is sometimes debility
or weakness in rapidly growing boys and girls which is
attributed to this cause. It is popularly supposed that port
wine or beer, is the great remedy; but nothing can be worse.
It is true that gin given continuously to puppies will keep them
small, but no one would advocate the amount of spirit required
in proportion by a lad or girl to produce the same effect. If
the growth could be checked by chemicals it would be most
injurious to do so.</p>

<p>“In the treatment of such cases fresh air by day and night
is essential; cold sponging, followed by friction with a rough
towel, and exercise are desirable.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>


<h4>PNEUMONIA.</h4>

<p>Dr. Julius Poheman says in <i>Medical News</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The effect of alcohol upon nearly all the organs of the body
has been carefully investigated. But, strange to say, literature
contains only a few straggling hints upon the action of alcohol
on the pulmonary tissue. It has long been known that the
abuse of alcohol is a predisposing cause of death when the
drinker is attacked with pneumonia. No experimental evidence
has been published of the action of alcohol in producing pathological
conditions in the lungs. In order to determine this
action, a series of experiments was made upon dogs in the winters
of 1890-1891 and 1892-1893. The dogs were a mixed lot
of mongrels gathered in by the city dog catchers. They varied
in weight from fifteen to twenty-five pounds, and were apparently
in good health. In all, thirty animals were experimented
on.</p>

<p>“The experiments were performed as follows:&mdash;A carefully
etherized animal had injected into his trachea just below the
larynx a quantity of commercial alcohol varying from one dram
to one ounce in amount. The effects of equal amounts of alcohol
upon animals of the same weight varies greatly. Two dogs,
weighing twenty-five pounds each, were injected with two
drams of alcohol. One died in one hour, and the other in six
hours after the injection. Four other dogs, two weighing
twenty-four pounds each, another eighteen pounds, and the
fourth fifteen pounds, were all injected with the same amount,
two drams. All four survived, and were as well as usual in
four weeks. Another dog of eighteen pounds died five minutes
after an injection of two drams, while another of fifteen pounds
took one ounce and recovered.</p>

<p>“The symptoms in the dogs were all alike, dyspnea, increasing
as the inflammation increased, until the accessory muscles
of respiration were called into play. The stethoscope showed
that air had great difficulty in entering the bronchi and air
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>vesicles, and showed also the tumultuous beating of the heart in
pumping blood through the lung. It was impossible to take the
temperatures. Post-mortem examinations showed the lungs
dark, congested and solid in some places. The air passages
were filled with frothy, bloody mucus, even in the dog that died
in five minutes. On section, the lungs were dark, congested,
and full of bloody mucus. This shows how acutely sensitive
the respiratory passages are to the action of alcohol. On microscopic
examination of the lungs, the air tubes and vesicles
were found filled with immense numbers of red and white corpuscles
and much mucus. The same picture was presented as
in a slide from the lungs of a broncho-pneumonic child.</p>

<p>“The striking similarity between the two is enough to prove
that the pathological condition is the same, and that alcohol
has produced a lesion very closely resembling, if not absolutely
like, that of broncho-pneumonia in the human subject. This
to some extent explains why drunkards attacked by pneumonia
succumb more readily than the temperate. The sensitive lung
tissue is enveloped in alcohol&mdash;flowing through the capillaries
of the lung on one side, and exhaled, filling the air vesicles and
tubes on the other. The condition must create a state of semi-engorgement
or of mild inflammation, similar to the drunkard’s
red nose, or his engorged gastric mucous membrane. Such a
state will reduce the vitality of the pulmonary tissue, and its
power of resistance to external influences. Add to this an inflammation
such as a pneumonia, and the lungs find themselves
unable to stand the pressure.”</p></div>

<p>As previous chapters contain much showing the
reasons why alcohol is dangerous in pneumonia,
space need not be taken here to do more than indicate
briefly some points of non-alcoholic treatment.</p>

<p>Pneumonia is generally supposed to result from a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>cold; it is ushered in by the symptoms of a chill,
followed by fever, headache, shortness of breath,
pain in chest, etc. It sometimes occurs as a complication
of typhoid fever and other acute diseases.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is not a very fatal disease in young and healthy subjects,
but in weak children, old persons and habitual drinkers, it is a
very fatal malady.”</p></div>

<p><i>Nature Cure</i> recommends a vapor bath immediately
upon the appearance of the first symptoms,
together with copious drinking of hot lemonade,
and a good supply of pure fresh air in the room,
together with the application of alternating hot and
cold compresses, <i>and no drugs</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Kellogg says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Cool compresses or ice-bags, alternated every three hours
by hot fomentations for ten minutes, should be applied to the
chest, particularly to the affected side, the seat of pain. The
hot fomentations relieve the pain, and the cold compresses
check the diseased process. The compresses should be wrung
out of cold water, and changed every five to eight minutes, or as
often as they become warm. Although the cool compresses
are not usually liked by the patient, they will soon give relief
if their use is continued, and they do much towards shortening
the course of the disease. Care should be taken to keep the
patient’s body from being wet except where the treatment is
applied. The cold compress is much used in the large hospitals
of Germany. When the pulse becomes as rapid as 95 to
110 or more, cool sponging, the wet-sheet pack, the cool full
bath or the cool enema should be employed. When much
chilliness is produced by the contact of water with the skin, the
cold enema is a most admirably useful measure. The amount
of water required is from half a pint to a pint. The tempera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>ture
may be 40 to 60 degrees. The apartment should be kept
as cool as possible without discomfort, and an abundance of
fresh air should be continually supplied.</p>

<p>“The diet of the patient should consist of milk, oatmeal
gruel, ripe fruit, and similar easily digested food. No meat,
eggs or other stimulating food should be allowed.</p>

<p>“Discontinue the cold treatment after the first twenty-four to
forty-eight hours. If the surface is cold, apply hot sponging or
a hot pack. Avoid causing chilliness.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pre-Natal Influence of Alcohol</span>:&mdash;“The use of beer
as a medicine during pregnancy is without doubt perilous to
the health and vigor of the offspring. Children born under
such conditions are sickly and feeble, and suffer from disease
more severely than others, or die early. Alcoholic prescriptions
to pregnant women are, from all present knowledge of the
facts, both dangerous and reprehensible in the highest degree.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
T. D. Crothers</span>, Hartford, Conn.</p>

<p>“M. Fere, an eminent French physician, recently reported to
the Biological Society of Paris the results of experiments which
he had been conducting for the purpose of throwing light upon
this question. These experiments demonstrate that the exposure
of hen’s eggs to the influence of the vapor of alcohol,
previous to incubation, retards the development of the embryo,
and favors the production of malformations. It is evident from
these experiments that alcohol may act directly upon the embryo
when there is no marked influence of alcoholism in the
parent.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pain After Food</span>:&mdash;“This may occur in acute or chronic
gastric catarrh, or in a neuralgic or oversensitive condition of
the stomach, or in ulcer or cancer of that organ. In all these
it comes on soon after food has been swallowed; but, if occurring
a long time after a meal, it is probably due to atonic dyspepsia.
Alcohol will undoubtedly sometimes relieve this kind of
pain by deadening the nerves of the stomach so that the pain is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>not felt so much; but this effect soon passes off, and if the cause
of the malady is not removed by other means, increasing quantities
of alcohol will be required to give relief. Many cases of
drink-craving have originated in this way. Medical aid will generally
be required. A small mustard poultice over the pit of the
stomach is often useful, especially in inflammatory cases, or any
other outward application of heat. Food should be fluid, or
semi-fluid, and digestible. Ginger tea, or peppermint water,
may serve to disperse gas.”</p></div>


<h4>POISON, ANIMAL.</h4>

<p>The following by Dr. Chas. H. Shepard, of Brooklyn,
who introduced the Turkish bath into America,
is taken from the <i>Journal of the A. M. A.</i>, for
Nov. 13, 1897:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Animal poison is by no means uncommon, and so quick
and mysterious is its action that a prompt remedy is a vital necessity.
There is good reason to believe that the numerous
remedies that have been recommended from earliest times as
antidotes for animal poison are worthless, as they have not the
properties commonly ascribed to them. The paucity of remedies
is so great that alcohol is the one which comes most
quickly to the mind of those who have been taught in the traditions
of the past, and who are not fully aware of its action on
the human system. We shall endeavor to show that the action
of alcohol is not helpful, but on the contrary is really detrimental;
and also that there is a better way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>“If we get a splinter in the body, vital energy is aroused to
get rid of the offending substance, inflammation is set up, and
sloughing goes on until the splinter is voided. If the splinter
is covered with acrid material, the same process is intensified,
and nature endeavors to eliminate the offending substance
through the natural excretions. Upon the peculiarity of the
material depends the direction of this elimination.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>“It is well known that some poisons are thrown off by the
kidneys, some by the lungs, while others again are attacked by
all the emunctories. The difference in the power of the system
to absorb different substances, appropriate whatever can
be utilized, and throw off whatever can not be used, is sometimes
called idiosyncrasy, but more properly it may be called
vital resistance, and upon the integrity of this power rests the
ability to combat disease in all its forms, whether it be the absorption
of any animal virus or the poison resulting from undigested
food. This ability is in proportion to the integrity and
soundness of every tissue and organ of the body. This may be
illustrated by the fact that with a person suffering from kidney
disease, which necessarily impedes elimination, the ordinary
effects of a poison are intensified; therefore whatever aids in
the promotion of good health, or in other words, the normal
action of all the functions, will contribute to the safety of the
individual in any and every emergency.</p>

<p>“When a person dies from the effect of poisoning, it is simply
because the system was unable to eliminate the offending
substance and was exhausted in the effort. There is a tolerance
of some substances which frequently results in chronic disease,
and again it is shown in what is called the cumulative effect or
acute disease.</p>

<p>“Those who would hold that a substance is at one time a
medicament, and at another time a poison, have much trouble
in drawing the line between the beneficial and the poisonous
effect. The idea that poisonous substances act on the system
is responsible for many grave mistakes, whereas always, and
under all circumstances, it is the system that does all the action.</p>

<p>“There might be some excuse for the idea that disease is an
entity, from the facts that have been brought to light by the
germ theory, but this theory is of recent date, while the entity
theory is as old as superstition.</p>

<p>“Snake poison, which may be cited as a type of other animal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>poisons, takes effect through the circulation, and acts by paralyzing
the nerve centres, and by altering the condition of the
blood. In ordinary cases death seems to take place by arrest
of respiration, from paralysis of the nerves of motion. The
poison also acts septically, producing at a later period sloughing
and hemorrhage.</p>

<p>“Dr. Calmette, a noted French scientist, claims that what is
poisonous in the snake’s bite, is not the venom absorbed into
the blood, but a principle which the blood itself has developed
out of the poison. This would necessitate very quick action
when the poison is inserted in one of the large veins, as that is
followed by instant death.</p>

<p>“The following cases fairly represent some of the tragedies
that are occurring in our everyday life.</p>

<p>“A man 60 years old falls and dislocates his finger, he goes
to the hospital, where in a short time he dies from blood poisoning.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Another man 48 years old, many years a wine
merchant, whose great toe was severely crushed by a heavy
man stepping on it, was taken with blood-poisoning and in
spite of all treatment, even to the amputation of the leg, he
soon succumbed to the disease. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A young woman
24 years old, picks a pimple on her chin and at once her face
begins to swell. In vain was all medical treatment, for in a
few days she died in terrible agony. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* About a year
ago there died in Brooklyn, N. Y., a physician in his 38th year,
who six days previously received a slight scratch in his hand
while performing a post-mortem examination. All that medical
science could suggest was done to no avail. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In
the summer of 1896 a young woman 22 years of age was bitten
on the leg by an insect. Several physicians were called in but
their treatment gave no relief; blood-poisoning set in; it was
decided to amputate the leg, but before it could be done she
died. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In July, 1896, a veterinary surgeon 34 years
of age, while removing a cancer from a horse pricked his finger
with his knife. The wound was so slight that he forgot all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>about it. A few days later blood-poisoning set in and in a
short time his end came. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Some forty years ago a
man named Whitney was teasing a rattlesnake in a Broadway
barroom, was bitten by it, and, though whisky was poured
down his throat by the quart, he soon died.</p>

<p>“Such results seem entirely unnecessary were the proper
course pursued, and at the same time they are a fearful commentary
on the medical resources of the day.</p>

<p>“The latest researches in regard to alcohol reveal it as a
poison to the human system in whatever way it may be diluted
or disguised. Its effect is always the same in proportion to the
amount taken. It is impossible to habitually use it in any
form, even in small quantities, without disease and degeneration
resulting therefrom. When taken into the stomach the
action is the same as with any other narcotic; the meaning of
this word is <i>to become torpid</i>. It benumbs the nerves of sensation,
and thus the vital resistance to any offending material is
reduced, and while the patient <i>feels</i> less of any disturbance the
real harm goes on with accumulated force because of the lack
of vitality and non-resistance of the nervous system.</p>

<p>“When the body is in the throes of a vital struggle with a
virulent poison it would seem, to any unprejudiced mind, the
height of folly to further weaken the vital resistance by the
administration of any narcotic, and especially alcohol.</p>

<p>“The eminent German, Professor Bunge, says: ‘All the
results which on superficial observation appear to show that
alcohol possesses stimulant properties, can be explained on the
ground that they were due to paralysis.’ *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Professors
S. Weir Mitchell and E. T. Reichert, in <i>Researches on Serpent
Poison</i>, make this notable statement: ‘Despite the
popular creed, it is now pretty sure that many men have been
killed by the alcohol given to relieve them from the effects of
snake bite, and it is a matter of record that men dead drunk
with whiskey and then bitten, have died of the bite.’</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>“As a great contrast to the weakness of the mass of our
people who are drug-takers and alcohol-consumers, and who
are liable to almost any epidemic that comes along, and quickly
succumb to a serious injury, may be mentioned the Turkish
soldiers of to-day, who know nothing of drugs as we use them
and never use alcohol in any form. During the late controversy
with the Greeks, one of them who was reported as having been
shot in the stomach, remained in the ranks, and afterward
walked ten miles. Another one who was wounded twice in
the legs and once in the shoulder, continued attending to his
duties for twenty-four hours, until an officer noticed his condition
and ordered him to the hospital. The heat was tremendous,
but the troops endured it without complaint, and the
doctors were astonished at the wonderful vitality of the wounded
Turks, who recovered with remarkable rapidity. This, with good
reason, is attributed to their abstemious lives.</p>

<p>“It has been stated that the Moqui Indians handle the
rattlesnake with impunity, and are not inconvenienced by its
occasional bite.</p>

<p>“The rational treatment of animal poison is to endeavor to
prevent the entry of the virus into the circulation and to neutralize
it in the wound before it is absorbed; but when it has entered
the system everything should be done for its elimination.</p>

<p>“The most powerful aid to the human system, and the most
perfect eliminator known to man is heat. It is used with much
advantage, and great success by means of water, both internally
and externally, but above all is its use by hot air, as in the
Turkish bath, which works in harmony with every natural
function, promoting the action of all the secretions, and more
particularly the excretions. By this means will the system unload
itself of an accumulation of impurities in an incredibly
short space of time, while the heat aids in destroying whatever
there may be of virus therein.</p>

<p>“Calmette, whom we have previously quoted, has shown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>that whatever be the source of snake venom, its active principle
is destroyed by being submitted to a temperature of about 212
degrees for a variable length of time.</p>

<p>“In the not remote future thousands of human beings will
owe to the Turkish bath not only an immunity from disease
in general, but also an escape from the horrors of a premature
death from hydrophobia, the poison of snake bite, or the slower
action of infectious disease.</p>

<p>“The mass of testimony that has been accumulating for
over thirty years past is more than sufficient to convince any
reasonable mind that is willing to examine the facts.</p>

<p>“The medical profession has searched the world over and
under for the means of controlling disease, while within the
human body itself lies the vital power which needs only to be
cultivated and exalted to its true function to banish the mass
of disease from the land.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Shepard states in another article that Turkish
baths are now used in London and Paris for the
cure of hydrophobia.</p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A great number of remedies have acquired the reputation
of being cures for snake bites. The partisans of each one of
these have been able to produce a large number of cases, which
apparently supported their claims; the uniform testimony of all
scientific authorities upon this subject, however, is that all these
so-called antidotes are worthless. Prof. W. Watson Cheyne,
M. B., F. R. C. S., surgeon of Kings College Hospital, London,
England, states, in the <i>International Encyclopedia of Surgery</i>,
that ‘there is no known antidote by which the venom can be
neutralized, nor any prophylactic.’ This eminent authority also
remarks further: ‘Hence medication with this view is to be
avoided altogether, and the aim of treatment should be to prevent
the poison from gaining access to the general circulation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>and to avoid its prostrating effects if its entrance has already
taken place.’ The same writer asserts that the only aim of the
constitutional treatment should be ‘to sustain the strength until
the poison shall have been eliminated.’ The idea that the
saturation of the body with whisky to the point of intoxication,
if possible, is beneficial in these cases, is in the highest degree
erroneous. Whisky intoxication, according to Dr. Cheyne,
actually ‘favors the injurious effect of the poison. What is required
is to keep the patient alive until the poison has been
eliminated.’ Whisky will not do this, but actually aids the
poison in its fatal work by lessening the resistance of the
patient, and hence lessening his chances for recovery.</p>

<p>“The reputation of whisky as a remedy in these cases is due
to the fact that on an average only one person in eight who is
bitten by a rattlesnake is really poisoned; the reasons for this
were fully explained in an interesting paper on ‘Rattlesnakes,’
by the eminent Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, and published in the
Smithsonian Contributions to <i>Knowledge</i> for 1860. If the
snake strikes several times before inflicting a wound, the sacs
containing the venom may be emptied, so that the succeeding
bite will introduce only the most minute quantity of poison&mdash;not
enough to produce serious, or fatal results. If the part
bitten is covered by clothing, the poison may be absorbed by
the clothing, so that but very little enters the circulation. In
various other ways the snake is prevented from inflicting a fatal
wound. The popular idea, that every bite of a rattlesnake is
necessarily poisonous, is thus shown to be erroneous. It is not
at all probable that the administration of whisky has ever in
any case contributed to the long life of a person bitten by a
rattlesnake.</p>

<p>“Whisky is often recommended by physicians with the idea
that it will sustain the energies of the patient, or will stimulate
the heart, etc.; but it has been clearly shown that alcohol
in all forms is not only useless for these purposes, but does
actual damage, since it lessens the resistance of the patient,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>weakens the heart, and helps along the prostration which is the
characteristic effect of the rattlesnake venom. Alcohol has,
for many years, been used as an antidote for collapse under an
anæsthetic administered for surgical purposes, but no intelligent
physician nowadays thinks of using alcohol for such a purpose;
instead, alcohol is given before the anæsthetic for the purpose
of facilitating its effect. Errors of this sort which have once
become established are very hard to uproot. Probably some
physicians will continue to use alcohol for shock, exhaustion,
general debility and similar conditions as well as for rattlesnake
poisoning for another quarter of a century, but such use
of alcohol does not belong to the domain of rational medicine
and is not supported by scientific facts.”</p>

<p>“Under the Pasteur method, a man who did not take alcohol
was much more likely to recover from the bite of a mad dog
than one bitten under the same conditions, who used that drug;
while in lock-jaw there was absolute failure to secure immunity
if the patient had taken alcohol. In India it used to be given in
large quantities for snake bite, but it was found that it had a
direct effect in interfering with the processes of repair, and so
is being abandoned.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Sims Woodhead</span>, of the Royal
College of Physicians and Surgeons, London, Eng.</p>

<p>“Nothing could be more irrational and dangerous than the
popular notion concerning the antagonism of whisky and
snake-bites, and Willson reports that several of the fatalities in
his series were directly due to alcohol rather than to the
bite.”&mdash;<i>Editorial, Journal of the American Medical Ass’n.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rheumatism</span>:&mdash;“Unquestionably, the most active cause of
rheumatism, as well as of migraine, sick-headache, Bright’s
disease, neurasthenia and a number of other kindred diseases,
is the general use of flesh food, tea and coffee, and alcoholic
liquors. As regards remedies, there are no medicinal agents
which are of any permanent value in the treatment of chronic
rheumatism. The disease can be remedied only by regimen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>&mdash;that
is, by diet and training. A simple dietary, consisting of
fruits, grains, and nuts, and particularly the free use of fruits,
must be placed in the first rank among the radical curative
measures. Water, if taken in abundance, is also a means of
washing out the accumulated poisons.</p>

<p>“An individual afflicted with rheumatism in any form should
live, so far as possible, an out-of-door life, taking daily a sufficient
amount of exercise to induce vigorous perspiration. A
cool morning sponge bath, followed by vigorous rubbing, and a
moist pack to the joints most seriously affected, at night, are
measures which are worthy of a faithful trial. Every person
who is suffering from this disease should give the matter immediate
attention, as it is a malady which is progressive, and is
one of the most potent causes of premature old age, and general
physical deterioration. American nervousness is probably more
often due to uric acid, or to the poisons which it represents,
than to any other one cause.”&mdash;<i>Good Health.</i></p>

<p>“Alcohol favors the development of rheumatism. It does
this by preventing waste matter from leaving the system. Beer
and wine, because they contain lime and salts, are said to
cause rheumatism, or at least to aid in its development. These
salts are absorbed into the system, unite with the uric acid,
and form an insoluble urate of lime, which is deposited around
the joints, thus causing them to become enlarged and stiff. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The success of the Turkish bath treatment has been phenomenal.
Of over 3,000 cases treated here at least 95 per cent.
have been entirely relieved, or greatly helped. Some who were
treated over twenty years ago have stated that they have not
had a twinge of rheumatism since. Very few have persevered
in the use of the bath without experiencing permanent relief.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Charles H. Shepard</span>, Brooklyn.</p>

<p>“Those having a bath cabinet can have a good substitute at
home for the Turkish bath. Remember that if tobacco and alcohol
are indulged in, there can be no permanent relief.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The New Hygiene</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Under no circumstances take any of the thousand and one
nostrums advertised as sure cures for this disease. Pure unadulterated
blood is the only remedy. This can only be produced
by cleansing the system of impurities, and giving it the
right kind of material out of which to make it. Keep out the
poisonous physic, clean out the colon, strengthen the lungs, and
feed the system with proper food, and this disease will vanish
like a fog before the rising sun.”</p></div>

<p>The same book in advocating the use of the Turkish
bath for rheumatism, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The fact, which is well attested, that when a person enters
the bath the urine may be strongly acid, but, on leaving the
bath, after half an hour, it is markedly alkaline, shows that the
bath has a strong effect upon the system.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Ridge says of <i>rheumatic fever</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I would urge most strongly the desirability of avoiding
every form of alcoholic liquor, from the very commencement of
the disease, as affording the best chance for a speedy and safe
recovery. The highest authorities are agreed on this point, but
there is a lingering practice which makes reference necessary in
order to confirm the wavering.”</p></div>

<p>In Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York, the hot blanket
pack is used in acute rheumatism, almost to the exclusion
of other methods. The pack should be
continued two to four hours at least, and may be
repeated two or three times within the twenty-four
hours with advantage.</p>

<p><i>Nature Cure</i> says that thorough massage, and
half a dozen cups of hot lemonade will cure a severe
case of sciatica:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The massage should be commenced moderately, and increased
as the patient can bear it. Rubbing and slapping of
the muscles with bare hands will hasten a cure, and be agreeable
to the patient. One to two hours treatment, if <i>vigorous</i>,
will effect a cure.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sea-Sickness</span>:&mdash;Brandy is a common resort in
this trouble, many taking it under such circumstances
who would under no other. Yet it frequently
adds to the sickness, instead of relieving
it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Be sparing in diet for two or three days before the expected
voyage. If very sensitive, take to your berth as soon as you
go on board, or lie down on deck; get near the centre of the
vessel, and lie with your feet to the stern. Go to sleep if
possible. Iced water may be sipped, but nothing solid should
be taken at first; after a while a cracker or wafer may be
taken.”</p></div>

<p>It is said upon good authority that if two or three
apples are eaten shortly before going on board, or
before rough water is encountered, sea-sickness is
entirely averted. It will be well to partake of no
other food for some hours previous to the voyage
when trying this.</p>

<p><i>Good Health</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If any of our readers have occasion to cross the ocean in the
stormy season, we recommend three things; keep horizontal,
with the head low; put an ice-bag to the back of the neck,
keep the stomach clean, free from greasy foods and meats, and eat
nothing till there is an appetite for food. A habitually clean
dietary before going on board is doubtless a good preparation
for such a voyage, as well as for any other nerve strain, or test
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>of endurance. It pays to be good&mdash;to your stomach, as well as
in other ways.”</p></div>

<p>The following is guaranteed by a Russian physician
to be an effective cure and a means of avoiding
sea-sickness when the symptoms first make their
appearance. Take long and deep inspirations.
About twenty breaths should be taken every
minute, and they should be as deep as possible.
After thirty or forty inspirations the symptoms will
be found to abate. This is recommended for
dyspepsia also.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sore Nipples</span>:&mdash;“Alum water, or tannin, used for several
months in advance will harden as effectually as brandy. If
there is soreness on commencing to nurse, put a pinch of alum
into milk, and apply the curd to the nipple.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spasms</span>:&mdash;“These are caused by flatulence, as a result of
indigestion. A little hot ginger tea, or capsicum tea, may do
all that is required. If these are not at hand, loosen every
tight band, rub well the region of the heart and stomach, slap
the face with the corner of a wet towel, and give sips of cold
water.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shock</span>:&mdash;“In shock, or collapse, the state is similar in some
respects to that which is present in fainting. Every function is
almost at a standstill; absorption from the stomach and elsewhere
is at its lowest point, because the circulation of the
blood is so much interfered with. Hence much of the brandy
which is so often given, and to such a wonderful amount, with
very little apparent effect of intoxication, is really not absorbed
at all, and is very often rejected from the stomach by vomiting,
when reaction does occur, if not before.</p>

<p>“The patient should be wrapped up warmly, and put to bed
as soon as possible. The limbs may be rubbed with hot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>flannels, and hot water bottles put to hands and feet. In some
cases, also, towels wrung out of hot water may be wrapped
around the head. Hot milk and water, hot water slightly
sweetened, or with a little peppermint water in it, should be given
as soon as the patient can swallow. Hot beverages will warm
the skin more rapidly and powerfully than any alcoholic liquor.</p>

<p>“If the patient cannot swallow, an enema of hot water, or
hot, thin gruel, should be administered, and may be of use in
addition to hot drinks. Beef extract may be added to the hot
water with advantage.</p>

<p>“In the vast majority of cases there need be no anxiety so
far as the shock is concerned; reaction will occur in due time
if ordinary care be taken, and will be more natural and steady
if the system is not embarrassed by the presence of the narcotic
alcohol. In the state of collapse the voluntary nervous
system is depressed; alcohol diminishes the power and activity
of the nervous centres of the brain, hence its action is undesirable
in shock or collapse.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. J. Ridge</span>, London.</p>

<p>“No procedure could be more senseless than the administering
alcohol in shock. A stimulant of some kind is necessary
in such cases, and alcohol, instead of being a stimulant is a
narcotic. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Alcohol causes a decrease of temperature,
the very thing to be avoided in cases of shock.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J.
H. Kellogg</span>.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly sure that a large dose of alcohol in shock
puts a nail in the coffin of the patient.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. H. C. Wood</span> of
the University of Pennsylvania.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sinking Sensations</span>:&mdash;Many women have a
feeling of weakness or “goneness” at about eleven
o’clock in the morning, and are led by it to the
injurious practice of eating between meals. It is
often due to indigestion, or to the use of beer or
wine. A few sips of hot milk, of fruit juice, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>even of cold water will often relieve it, especially if
total abstinence is persevered in.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sudden Illness</span>:&mdash;“Those taken suddenly ill are likely to
fare best if placed in a recumbent position, with head slightly
elevated, all tightness of garments about the neck or waist
relieved, and a little cold water given in case of ability to
swallow. A mustard plaster on the back of the neck, or over
the stomach, and hot water or hot bottles to the feet, are never
out of place, while vinegar, or smelling salts, or dilute ammonia
to the nostrils is reviving.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezra M. Hunt</span>, M. D., late
secretary of New Jersey State Board of Health.</p>

<p>“Both the popular and professional beliefs in the efficacy of
alcoholic liquids for relieving exhaustion, faintness, shock, etc.
are equally fallacious. All these conditions are temporary, and
rapidly recovered from by simply the recumbent position, and
free access to fresh air. Ninety-nine out of every hundred of
such cases pass the crisis before the attendants have time to
apply any remedies, and when they do, the sprinkling of cold
water on the face, and the vapor of camphor or carbonate of
ammonia to the nostrils, are the most efficacious remedies, and
leave none of the secondary evil effects of brandy, whisky or
wine.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. N. S. Davis.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunstroke</span>:&mdash;“There has lately been a correspondence in
the <i>Morning Post</i> on the subject of ‘Sunstroke and Alcohol.’
We quite agree with the statement that ‘nothing predisposes
people to sunstroke so much as this pernicious habit of taking
stimulants (so-called) during the hot weather.’ As far as this
country is concerned, nearly every case of sunstroke might be
more appropriately designated ‘beerstroke.’ One effect of
alcohol is to paralyze the heat-regulating mechanism; the blood
becomes overloaded with waste material, and the narcotism,
and vasomotor paralysis, produced by the alcohol, is added to
that produced by the heat. Abstainers, other things being
equal, can always endure extremes of temperature better than
consumers of alcohol.”&mdash;<i>Medical Pioneer</i>, England.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>“During the month of January, 1896, there occurred over three
hundred deaths from sunstroke in Australia. When called
upon to offer suggestions relative to its prevention, the medical
board promptly informed the Colonial government that, of all
the predisposing causes, none were so potent as indulgence in
intoxicating liquors, and in its treatment nothing seemed to
have a more disastrous effect than the administration of alcoholic
stimulants.”&mdash;<i>Medical News.</i></p></div>

<p>The <i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i> for August, 1896,
contained the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Recently a leading medical man, a teacher in a college,
warned his student audience against the anti-alcoholic theories
urged by extremists and persons whose zeal was greater than
their intelligence. He affirmed positively that the value of
alcohol was well known in medicine, and established by long
years of experience.</p>

<p>“Not long afterward a man was brought into his office in a
state of collapse from sunstroke, and this physician and teacher
ordered large quantities of brandy to be administered; the patient
died soon after.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers tells of a case where alcohol
was administered to a child for partial sunstroke,
and says, “there were many reasons for believing
that the profound poisoning from alcohol gave a
permanent bias and tendency that developed into
inebriety later.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When a person falls with sunstroke (or heatstroke) he
should at once be carried to a cool, shady place. His clothing
should be removed, and cold applications made to the head,
and over the whole body. Pieces of ice may be packed around
the head, or cold water may be poured upon the body. Cold
enema may also be employed. In case the face is pale, hot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>applications should be made to the head and over the heart
and the body should be rubbed vigorously.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. H. Kellogg.</span></p></div>


<h4>TYPHOID FEVER.</h4>

<p>As many lives are lost by this disease, its treatment
must ever be one of intense interest, not only
to physicians, but also to all humanity. Since
non-alcoholic treatment has reduced the death-rate
in typhoid to five per cent., the views regarding such
treatment expressed by leading practitioners will
doubtless be read with eagerness.</p>

<p>The following is a paper by Dr. N. S. Davis
taken from the <i>Medical Temperance Quarterly</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Alleged Indications for the Use of Alcohol in
the Treatment of Typhoid Fever</span>:&mdash;On the first page of
the first number of a new medical journal bearing date July, 1895,
may be found the following statement: ‘The question of administering
alcohol comes up in every case of typhoid fever. In mild
cases, especially when the patient is young, healthy and temperate,
stimulants are not needed so long as the disease follows
the typical course. Here, as elsewhere, alcohol should be
avoided when not absolutely demanded. There is, however,
generally such a dangerous tendency toward nervous exhaustion,
that in a majority of cases more or less alcohol is required.
The indication which calls for its use is an inability to administer
enough food. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Again, the existence of high
temperature nearly always makes it necessary to stimulate the
patient, as does threatened nervous exhaustion and heart
failure, for immediate effect; likewise a weak, small, compressible,
rapid pulse, with impaired cardiac impulse and systolic
sound, is a frequent indication; other remedies may be required,
but alcohol cannot be dispensed with.’ The next para<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>graph
continues: ‘It is necessary to give alcohol in serious
complications of typhoid fever, such as pneumonia, pleurisy,
hemorrhage and severe bronchitis or diarrhœa. It is best to begin
giving it early and in small quantities: two to six ounces is
a moderate amount, eight to twelve ounces daily is not too
much for adynamic or complicated cases.’</p>

<p>“The foregoing quotations purport to have been condensed
from one of our recent authoritative works on practical medicine,
and doubtless fairly represent the prevailing opinions
concerning the use of alcohol in the treatment of typhoid and
other fevers, both in and out of the profession. A careful
reading will show that the whole is founded on the following
four assumptions:</p>

<p>“1. That alcohol when taken into the living body acts as a
general stimulant, and especially so to the cardiac and vasomotor
functions. 2. That in mild, uncomplicated cases of
typhoid fever in young and previously healthy subjects, stimulants
are not required and no alcohol should be given. 3. That
in a ‘majority of cases’ the tendency toward dangerous ‘nervous
exhaustion’ and ‘heart failure’ is so great that the giving
of ‘more or less alcohol is required.’ 4. The amount required
may vary from two to twelve or more ounces per day.</p>

<p>“In the two preceding numbers of this journal, I have endeavored
to show that the chief causes of nervous exhaustion
and heart failure, in typhoid and other fevers were impairment
of the hemoglobin and corpuscular elements of the blood, deficient
reception and internal distribution of oxygen, and molecular
degeneration of the muscular structures of the heart itself.
These important pathological conditions are doubtless caused
by the specific toxic agent or agents giving rise to the fever.
Consequently the rational objects of treatment are to stop the
further action of the specific cause, either by neutralization, or
elimination, or both; to stop the further impairment of the
hemoglobin and other elements of the blood; and to increase
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>the reception and internal distribution of oxygen, by which we
will most effectually prevent further fatty or granular degeneration
of cardiac and other structures. The language of the
paragraphs I have quoted, fairly assumes that alcohol is a
<i>stimulant</i> capable of relieving nervous exhaustion and cardiac
failures, regardless of the causes producing those pathological
conditions, and consequently its use is necessary in the ‘majority
of cases’ of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>“Can such an assumption be sustained by either established
facts, or correct reasoning? Can nervous and cardiac exhaustion,
induced by the presence of toxic agents in the blood, with
deficiency of both hemoglobin and oxygen, be relieved by a
simple <i>stimulant</i>, that neither neutralizes nor eliminates the
toxic agents, nor increases either the hemoglobin or oxygen?
That alcohol does not neutralize or destroy toxic ptomaines, or
tox-albumins, is proved by abundant clinical experience, and also
by the fact that chemists use it freely in the processes for separating
these substances from other organic matters for experimental
purposes. That its presence in the living body retards
metabolic changes generally, and thereby aids in retaining
instead of eliminating toxic agents of all kinds, has been so
fully shown in the pages of preceding numbers of the <i>Medical
Temperance Quarterly</i>, that the leading facts need not be repeated
here. That its presence does not increase the hemoglobin,
or favor oxy-hemoglobin or increased internal distribution
of oxygen, but decidedly the reverse, has been equally well
demonstrated by numerous and reliable experimental researches
in this and other countries.</p>

<p>“Then it must be conceded that alcohol is not capable of
fulfilling either of the important indications presented in the
treatment of typhoid fever as stated above. Nevertheless, the
advocates of its use apparently recognize but two ideas or
factors in these cases, namely, the popularly inherited assumption
that alcohol is a <i>stimulant</i>, and as the patient is in danger
from nervous and cardiac weakness, therefore the alcohol must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>be given, <i>pro re nata</i> without the slightest regard to the existing
causes of the weakness, or the <i>modus operandi</i> of the so-called
stimulant.</p>

<p>“This is proved by the fact that they group together as
stimulants, and give to the same patient in alternate doses,
remedies of directly antagonistic action, as alcohol and strychnine,
or digitalis, etc.</p>

<p>“The accepted definition of a stimulant in medical literature,
is some agent capable of exciting or increasing <i>vital activity</i> as
a whole, or the natural activity of some one structure or organ.</p>

<p>“For instance, both clinical and experimental observations
show that strychnine directly increases the functional activity of
the respiratory, cardiac and vasomotor nervous systems, and
thereby increases the internal distribution of oxygen, which is
nature’s own special exciter of all vital action. Therefore it is
properly a direct respiratory, cardiac and vasomotor stimulant
and indirectly a stimulator of all vital processes. But the same
kind of clinical and experimental observations show that
alcohol directly diminishes the functional activity of all nerve
structures, pre-eminently those of respiration and circulation,
and also of all metabolic processes, whether respirative, disintegrative
or secretory. Consequently it not only acts as directly
antagonistic to strychnine, but equally so to all true stimulants
or remedies capable of increasing vital activity. Instead, therefore,
of meriting the name of <i>stimulant</i>, alcohol should be designated
and used only as an anæsthetic and sedative, or
depressor of vital activity.</p>

<p>“And a thorough and impartial investigation will show that its
use in the treatment of typhoid and other fevers, while deceiving
both physician and patient, by its anæsthetic effect in diminishing
restlessness, both prolongs the duration and increases
the ratio of mortality of the disease, by its impairment of vital
activity in the organizable elements of both blood and tissues.”</p></div>

<p>Equally interesting is the following outline of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>treatment pursued by Dr. W. H. Riley, of the Battle
Creek Sanitarium.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The purpose of the present paper is to give briefly an outline
of the method of treatment of typhoid fever as used by the
writer in a considerable number of cases.</p>

<p>“A consideration of the pathology of this disease does not
properly come under this head, but we wish simply to call attention
to the well-known fact that typhoid fever is a germ
disease. The germ which causes this fever has generally been
supposed to be the bacillus of Eberth. More recent bacteriological
studies rather indicate that the bacillus coli may also
cause the disease. These germs are usually carried into the
body in food or drink, and, lodging in the small intestines, begin
to grow and multiply, and by their life produce poisonous
ptomaines which are absorbed and carried by the circulation to
all the organs and tissues of the body.</p>

<p>“It is these ptomaines, thus carried to all parts of the body,
that are largely the immediate cause of the pyrexia and attending
symptoms. The organisms which produce these poisons
for the most part remain in the intestines, although they have
been found in the spleen.</p>

<p>“The indications for treatment are:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. To remove or destroy the cause (to eliminate the germs
and ptomaines from the body).</p>

<p>“2. To sustain the vital and resisting powers of the patient.</p>

<p>“If the patient is seen early in the disease, it has been my
practice to immediately put him to bed and give a free dose of
magnesium sulphate. This is preferably given in the morning
or forenoon, and may be repeated once or twice on successive
days. Besides this the patient should have a large enema of
water at a temperature of from 75° to 80° F.; and this may be
repeated daily or even oftener, for some time, if necessary, to
keep the bowels empty of the poisonous substances.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>“The salines and enemas thus used carry out bodily a large
number of germs and ptomaines that are present in the intestines;
and further, the salines, by producing an increased
secretion of the mucous membrane of the intestines, tend to
disentangle and set free many of the germs that have found a
lodging place in the walls of the intestines.</p>

<p>“For the elimination of the ptomaines which have been absorbed
into the circulation and carried to the tissues, nothing is
better than the internal use of water. From three to five pints
should be drunk during every twenty-four hours. It should be
taken in small quantities&mdash;six to eight ounces every hour or two
during waking hours, except when food is taken. I will refer
to this point more in detail later.</p>

<p>“A consideration of the general care of the patient properly
comes under the second head of the indications for treatment as
given above. The patient should be put to bed in a large, light,
well-ventilated room. At least two sides of the room should
communicate directly by windows with out-of-doors, in order
that the room may be properly ventilated.</p>

<p>“All unnecessary articles of furniture, such as carpets,
couches, upholstered chairs, pictures, etc. should be removed.</p>

<p>“The room should be thoroughly cleaned before the patient
is put into it.</p>

<p>“There should be two beds in the room for the use of the
patient. These should be, preferably, narrow and so placed in
the room that there is a free approach to both sides of the bed,
for the convenience of the nurse in giving treatment. Iron bedsteads
are preferable to wooden. The bedding should be firm,
yet soft and smoothly drawn. There should be just sufficient
covering to protect the body. The patient should be changed
from one bed to the other daily. This may be done by placing
the two beds side by side and carefully moving the patient
from one to the other. The sheets on the bed from which the
patient has been taken should be washed and disinfected at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>each change of the beds, and all other bedding should be thoroughly
aired and exposed to the sunlight daily.</p>

<p>“The patient should have the care of a thoroughly educated,
careful and competent nurse, one who understands perfectly
the various methods of using water in the treatment of fevers.</p>

<p>“There is no other single remedy that I consider so valuable
in the treatment of fever as the internal use of water. As
above stated, the patient should drink six or eight ounces every
hour during the waking hours, except for about two hours after
food is taken. The water should be thoroughly sterilized, and
as a rule may be taken either cool or hot. Ice water is objectionable.
Hot water is often preferable. This is a simple
remedy, but nevertheless is efficacious. It should be given to
the patient whether he calls for it or not, and it should be considered
an important part of his treatment. When water is
taken into the stomach and absorbed into the circulation, it
throws into solution the ptomaines which have been absorbed
from the intestines and are present in the circulation and tissues,
and thereby puts them in a favorable condition for elimination.
It increases the activity of the kidneys, and thus hastens and
increases the elimination of the poisons in the system.</p>

<p>“In the early stage of the fever, when the pulse is full, and
the action of the heart increased, it is best to give the patient
cool water. Later in the disease, when the action of the heart
is weak, and the patient feeble, it is best to give the water hot.</p>

<p>“Winternitz, many years ago, demonstrated that hot water
taken into the stomach acts as a cardiac stimulant, and the increased
heart’s action is immediate, or at least before the water
has time to absorb, which indicates that the water in the stomach
acts reflexly as a cardiac stimulant. The water after absorption
also increases the circulation by filling the blood-vessels,
and increasing arterial pressure. The writer has frequently
noticed a decided increase in the fullness, and rapidity of the
pulse, after a patient has drunk a glassful of hot water.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<p>“The external use of water also forms an important part of
the treatment. The patient should be sponged off with tepid
water every hour or two when the temperature is 103°, or above.
When the temperature is less than this, it is not necessary to
sponge the body so frequently. Sometimes a hot sponge bath
is more efficacious in reducing the temperature than the tepid
or cool bath. The sponge bath reduces the temperature, relieves
many of the distressing nervous symptoms, is refreshing
to the patient, and promotes sleep. The temperature of the
body may also be reduced by the use of cool compresses placed
over the abdomen, and changed frequently.</p>

<p>“The matter of diet is an important factor in the treatment
of typhoid fever. The diet should be aseptic, easily digested,
and should contain the necessary food elements. Probably no
one article of diet meets all these requirements as well as
sterilized milk. The patient should take from two to three
pints daily. The milk is best taken four times during the day
at intervals of four hours, taking eight to ten ounces at a time.
Should the patient become tired of the milk, gluten gruel may
be substituted for the milk.</p>

<p>“The diarrhœa and bowel symptoms, when present, may be
relieved by the application of hot fomentations to the abdomen,
warm or hot enemas and twenty grains of subnitrate of bismuth
given every four hours.</p>

<p>“The patient should be kept as quiet as possible, and should
be turned in bed at intervals, to prevent hypostatic congestion
and the formation of bed-sores. The bony prominences which
are apt to become eroded should be sponged frequently with a
solution of tannic acid in equal parts of alcohol and water;
a dram of the tannic acid to a pint of alcohol and water, is
about the proper strength to use.</p>

<p>“By the methods briefly outlined above&mdash;that is by the free
use of water internally and externally, by keeping the intestines
thoroughly emptied of poisonous material by the free and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>frequent use of enemas, by proper feeding and the careful
attention of a good nurse to the patient and his surroundings&mdash;the
duration of the fever may be shortened and the severity
of the disease lessened; heart failure, and other complications
will seldom occur, and the patient will in nearly every instance
make a good recovery. The best method to pursue to prevent
heart failure is to keep the poisons which are generated in the
bowels and absorbed into the body, and which are the
direct cause of the heart failure, eliminated from the body.
Should the heart become weak, it may be effectually stimulated
by giving hot water to drink, applying heat to the heart in the
form of a fomentation, and the application of fomentations to
the upper spine.</p>

<p>“In the treatment of a large number of cases of typhoid fever,
extending over several years’ practice, the writer has never
made use of alcohol internally to support the action of the
heart, or for any other purpose.</p>

<p>“The number of cases of death from typhoid fever coming
under the writer’s observation, where the method of treatment
pursued has been similar to that briefly indicated above, have
been very few, a much smaller per cent. than in practice where
alcohol has been used as a ‘cardiac stimulant.’ I believe that
the use of alcohol in the treatment of typhoid fever is not only
useless, but absolutely harmful.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Kate Lindsay, of Battle Creek Sanitarium and
Hospital, contributed an article upon Typhoid Fever
to the <i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i> for January,
1896, from which a few notes are here taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The chief toxic centre is evidently the intestinal tract,
especially the termination of the ileum. The ulcerations,
necroses, perforations and hemorrhages are most frequently
found in the last twelve inches of the small intestine, and may
extend into the large intestine. The ulcerated surface and
open vessels increase the facility with which the poison finds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>entrance into the circulation. The microbes, blood clots,
necrosed tissue and pus, furnish abundant supplies of toxic
matter, which, saturating the system, over-power and stop the
activity of the functions of all the organs of the body, causing
degeneration of tissues. Death is said to take place from
heart, lung or brain failure, but the failure involves every other
organ as well.</p>

<p>“Regarding the intestinal tract as any other abscess at this
time, the physician should seek for methods of treatment
or remedies which will remove the morbid matters, and
destroy, or at least inhibit their action, thus decreasing the
fever and stimulating the circulation. Secondary toxic centres
often develop in the course of this disease, notably in the
glands, lungs and dependent organs, the hypostatic congestion
resulting from lying in one position, causing stasis of blood,
death and necrosis of tissue, both of the external and internal
organs. All vessels connected with the dying tissues carry
toxins to other parts of the body. Suppurating glands, and phlebitis
of the femoral veins are examples of this secondary infection,
and are accountable for the heart failure and collapse so
often fatal during the second, third and fourth weeks of typhoid
fever. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The old idea that in peristaltic action lay the great danger of
increase of the hemorrhage and perforation of the bowels, is
giving way to the more rational view that gaseous distention
and septic absorption, are what bring about fatal results from
these complications, and that the moderate peristalsis of the
intestinal walls lessens these dangers by closing the gaping ends
of the injured vessels, and expelling the septic matter and foul
gases. To meet these indications I have found lavage of the
bowels, even during hemorrhage, with water of 105° to 110° F.
or even hotter, given in moderate quantity of from one pint to
three, to give great relief by freeing the large intestines of blood
clots, fecal matter and other morbid matter. It also increases
peristaltic action in the small intestines, thus favoring the expul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>sion
of gas. The heat stimulates the circulation in the peripheral
vessels of the intestines, and overcomes the tendency to
blood stasis.</p>

<p>“In the cases cited, ice-bags, alternated with fomentations,
were used over the abdomen externally, and heat, or hot and
cold, to spine. The extremities were kept warm. From ten to
thirty minims of turpentine, in an ounce of gum acacia or starch
water, increased the efficiency of the enemata, and aided in expelling
the gas and checking hemorrhage.</p>

<p>“The tendency to hypostatic congestion and bed-sores, was
prevented by frequent change of position, and the use of hot and
cold to the spine by fomentations and compresses, or better
still, hot fine spraying, or the alternate hot and cold spray. In
one grave case, spraying was kept up for about twelve hours,
with only short intermissions. The heart was stimulated by
heat applied over it, whenever depression and collapse threatened,
and by hot and cold sponging of the spine.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Noble said some time ago in the <i>London
Times</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Although it is true that alcohol is an antipyretic, yet its exhibition
neither shortens nor modifies (favorably) the diseases
of which the fever is but a symptom. The paralysis of the
brain which is so frequent a cause of death in typhoid fever, is
more often brought about by alcohol than any other cause, and
more than one woman suffering from puerperal fever has been
done to death by the administration of this substance, which,
not being <i>convenienter naturæ, is contra naturam</i>.”</p></div>

<p>J. S. Cain, M. D., in an able paper, read at the
Nashville Academy of Medicine, on “Rational Suggestions
in the Treatment of Typhoid Fever,” dissents
from the practice, which still obtains largely
in the medical profession, of administering alcoholic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>liquors, in the belief that they are “stimulants, conservators
of force and even nutrients,” and says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“After a careful and thoughtful study of this subject, I have
reluctantly, and against firm early convictions, been forced to the
conclusion that these theories with regard to the beneficial effects
of alcohol in disease are wholly fallacious. The only rational
conclusion at which I can arrive is that the agent is ever,
and under all circumstances, a depressor of temperature; that
it arrests the physiological interchange of carbonic acid gas and
oxygen in the tissues, as well as in the air vesicles of the
lungs; that it impedes the elimination of tissue waste, and
causes the accumulation of this refuse in the system; that it is
lethal anæsthetic in all quantities; that it is not stimulant in the
true sense, and never exerts that influence; and that it supplies
no element to the diseased and vitiated system calculated to
antagonize disease, repair waste, or invigorate lowered vital
forces, and therefore for these purposes is not called for in the
rational treatment of typhoid fever.”</p></div>

<p>At the annual meeting of the American Medical
Association held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1896, Dr.
G. B. Garber, of Dunkirk, Ind., read a paper upon
“Alcohol in Typhoid Fever” from which a few
points are here taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The fact that the mortality from typhoid fever seems to be
gradually lowering is no doubt due in great measure to the
non-use of alcohol in the treatment of the disease. Hardly a
week passes that some of our journals do not report a series of
cases treated without the aid of alcohol in any form. I used
alcohol in the treatment of the disease until two years ago,
when I became alarmed at the mortality; so I changed my
plan, and in 1894 I treated thirty-seven well marked cases of
varying degrees of intensity. I had two fatal cases, and in both
of them I had used alcohol. In 1895 I treated thirty cases of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>about the same type, with no death. I only used alcohol in
one of them, and it caused me more trouble than any of the
others. As this case was in the family of a saloon-keeper, I
could not control the matter, as they would give it during my
absence. On my return I would find the face flushed, the
temperature high, the pulse rapid and the patient nervous.
By close inquiry I would find that some of the family had
given ‘just a little good whisky’ which had been in the house
for twenty years.</p>

<p>“In closing, I wish to state that I am well convinced that in
the treatment of typhoid fever our patients will do better and
stand a greater chance of recovery, if we abstain entirely from
the use of alcohol in the treatment of the disease.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. J. Burney Yeo, of London, in a paper read
before the International Medical Congress held at
Rome, Italy, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In order to maintain the intestinal antisepsis which forms
an essential part of this method of treatment, I insist on the
necessity of scrupulous attention and caution in feeding patients
suffering from enteric fever, great danger arising from a failure
to note the extremely limited digestive and absorptive capacity
exhibited by such patients.</p>

<p>“In conclusion, the use of alcoholic stimulants, and the
common employment of depressing antipyretic agents, must be
condemned.”</p></div>

<p>In a report of the treatment of typhoid fever by
seventy-two physicians of Connecticut, thirty-eight
declared that they did not use alcohol in any stage
of this disease. The remainder used it sparingly in
the last stages, and only two considered it valuable
from the beginning of the disease.</p>

<p>In a discussion of typhoid fever by a medical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>society meeting in Rochester, N. Y., recently, sixty
physicians being present, only three spoke in favor
of using alcohol in this disease.</p>

<p>Hygienic physicians all insist upon a rigid fast as
long as the high temperature continues, or until the
patient is sufficiently hungry to eat a piece of plain,
stale, graham bread, “dry upon the tongue.” Dr.
Charles E. Page of Boston says there would be
very few relapses if this plan were carefully carried
out. He contends that the whisky and milk diet,
together with the not over-fresh air of the average
sick room is enough to produce fever in a healthy
person, hence is not likely to be conducive to recovery
in one already infected with the disease.</p>

<p>In an article in the <i>Arena</i> of September, 1892, Dr.
Page says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In my fever practice I have frequently observed the effect
of fasts of six, eight, ten and twelve days to be in the highest
degree productive of the health and comfort of patients, as, on
the other hand I have, during the past twenty years observed
the deplorable effects of the almost universal plan of constant
feeding. In some of the most distressing cases that have
happened to be thrown in my way, when all hope in the minds
of friends had been abandoned, I have found that withdrawal of
food, drugs and stimulants, and the substitution of simple, fresh,
soft water, has produced results that seemed almost miraculous.”</p></div>

<p>Fruit juices are now permitted by many physicians
in fever, a few drops of lemon or orange
juice, being a grateful addition to the water. Grape
juice, unfermented, is highly recommended by some.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>A young minister of great promise died recently
of typhoid fever. His young wife, only one year
married, is in settled melancholy, because she cannot
understand why “God took her husband.” Inquiry
developed the fact that the physician in attendance
was a believer in alcohol as a remedy, and used it
in this case. In view of the better chances of
recovery under non-alcoholic treatment shown by
comparative death-rates, may it not be that the
alcohol was responsible for the young man’s death,
instead of its being “God’s will to take him?”
The Author of all good has too frequently been
held responsible for the errors of physicians, and
the carelessness of nurses.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Vomiting</span>:&mdash;“If the vomiting is due to undigested food,
and the sickness can be traced to excess, or to improper diet,
draughts of hot water should be taken in order to be rid of
offending matter in the stomach. After the stomach is empty
bits of ice may be sucked, or cold water sipped. A quarter of
a Seidlitz powder may be taken. A flannel, folded to four
thicknesses, dipped in hot water, and wrung dry in a towel,
may be applied to the pit of the stomach. Cover the flannel
with a hot plate, being careful to have the flannel large enough
to prevent the plate’s burning the skin. Pin a dry towel over
all, around the body. This may be renewed every half-hour or
hour, as required. Sometimes a cold wet compress on the pit
of the stomach, covered with a dry towel is more efficacious,
heat developing by reaction. Fluid magnesia is often helpful.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Ridge.</span></p></div>

<h3>ALCOHOL AND NURSING MOTHERS.</h3>


<p>It frequently happens that the nursing mother
is unable by reason of defective digestive apparatus,
or imperfect assimilative powers, to supply sufficient
nourishment for her babe. In such case she
is often advised to drink ale or beer. It is true
that these liquors will excite the secretions of the
mammary gland, but it is increase in quantity, not
in quality, for the milk is impoverished by the added
water and alcohol, taken in the beer. Milkmen
sometimes salt cows heavily so that they will drink
largely of water, and thus give more milk, but one
quart of good, rich milk is worth three quarts of the
poor, thin stuff resulting from such method. It is
proper feeding, and care, that ensure good milk.</p>

<p>When women complain that they are unable to
nurse their babies the cause is often an error in
diet. Too great reliance is put upon meat as
strength-giving. While meat, used in moderation,
may be valuable to many persons, the nursing
mother should not depend upon it to any great extent.
She will find farinaceous foods, with plenty
of warm milk, what she most requires. At bed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>time
she should have a bowl of well-cooked oatmeal
gruel, diluted with rich milk, and sweetened,
if she prefer it so. The milk should be added to
the gruel while it is boiling, as it digests more readily
if scalded. People who cannot, or think they
cannot, take milk of itself, often find it easy to digest
it, after it is scalded in the gruel. Anything
that a mother can do in the way of nourishing her
babe will be done upon such a diet, that is, farinaceous
foods and milk. Sweet fruits are of course
valuable also, as tending to keep the system in
good order.</p>

<p>It is well to bear in mind that it is not the quantity
of food eaten, but that which is digested, and
assimilated, that goes to build up the tissues of the
body. So the habit of eating between meals is
pernicious, as it disturbs the digestive processes,
and robs the stomach of much-needed rest. This
habit is the cause, in many cases, of the falling off
in the milk after the first month or two.</p>

<p>As nourishment for both mother and babe can
come from food only, good appetite, and good digestion
are essential to health and strength. The
very best help towards gaining a good appetite is
exercise in the open air. All mothers recognize
the need of keeping their little ones out of doors a
while every day, but all do not see the necessity of
the same mode of life for themselves. Dr. Nathan
S. Davis has said: “I have persuaded thousands of
mothers to try fresh air, instead of wine or beer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>with gratifying results.” The mother who takes
her babe out, herself, for its daily airing, is laying
up stores of health and vitality, to aid her in providing
for the needs of the little one, dependent upon
her.</p>

<p>Good digestion is as essential as good appetite.
Alcohol, whether in beer, wine, whisky, or any
other form, is injurious to the stomach, and a hinderer
of digestion, hence must do harm, rather than
good, to the mother in search of added nourishment
for her babe.</p>

<p>Dr. Condi says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The only drink of the nurse should be water or milk. All
fermented and distilled liquors, as well as strong tea and coffee,
she should strictly abstain from. Never was there a more absurd
or pernicious notion than that wine, ale or porter is necessary
to a nursing mother in order to keep up her strength, or
to increase the quantity, and improve the properties of her milk.
So far from producing these effects, such drinks, when taken in
any quantity, invariably disturb more or less the health of the
stomach, and tend to impair the quality, and diminish the quantity,
of nourishment furnished by her to her infant.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. William Hargreaves says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Every farmer knows that all a healthy cow requires to give
good milk and butter is, to give her good feed, and pure water;
and he also knows that the way to make a cow give poor
watery milk, which they might churn until doomsday without
obtaining butter, is to feed her on distillery slops, or grains
from the brewery. It is also well known that cheese cannot be
made from such milk, it being deficient in curd, or casein.</p>

<p>“Alcohol is not only useless but injurious; for children
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>whose mothers try to keep themselves upon beer, etc., very
frequently suffer from vomiting and diarrhœa, and often from
convulsions. Sometimes a single glass of whisky, taken by the
mother, will produce sickness and indigestion in the child, for
twenty-four hours after.</p>

<p>“In the milk of a healthy woman the water ranges from 879
to 905 parts in 1,000. The oily substance ranges from 25 to
42; casein from 15 to 39; sugar of milk from 31 to 45, and the
salts from 1 to 4 parts in 1,000.</p>

<p>“Alcoholic drinks materially alter these proportions, for, on
the analysis of the milk of the same woman, a few hours before
and after the use of a pint of beer, it was found that the alcohol
increases the proportion of the water, and diminishes that of
casein; and that alcohol is very perceptible in it.”</p>

<p>“The only rational way to be adopted by mothers to increase
the supply of nutrition for their infants, is to secure plenty of
suitable nutritious food, prepared in the way that will most fit
it for digestion, while they at the same time, avoid as far as
possible all fatigue, and mental excitement. It is impossible
that alcoholic beverages can add anything to the nutrition of
either the infant or mother.”&mdash;Dr. Bussey, in <i>Stimulants for
Nursing Mothers</i>.</p></div>

<p>Dr. E. G. Figg, in <i>The Physiological Operation of
Alcohol</i>, gives the analyses of the milk of a temperate
woman in good health, and of a drinking woman
as follows:&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>Dr. Edward Smith says in his <i>Practical Dietary</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcoholics are largely used by many women in the belief
that they support the system, and maintain the supply of milk
for the infant; but I am convinced that this is a serious error,
and is not an infrequent cause of fits and emaciation in the
child.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. James Edmunds, of the Lying-In Hospital,
London, Eng., says in <i>Diet for Nursing Mothers</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The nursing mother is peculiarly placed, in that she has to
provide a supply of nutriment for the child which is dependent
upon her, as well as for the ordinary requirements of her own
system. The nutrition of the child is to be provided for upon
the same principles, and by the same food-elements, as is the
nutrition of the mother, the only difference being that the
young child is possessed of less perfect masticatory and digestive
powers, and therefore requires food to be presented to it
in a state more simple, uniform, and readily assimilable than
the adult, who is furnished with strong teeth, and possessed of
a fully-grown stomach. The mastication, digestion, and primary
assimilation of the nursing infant’s food is thrown upon the
mother’s organs; but the tissues of the child are nourished precisely
as are the tissues of the mother, and a nursing mother
requires simply to digest a larger supply of wholesome, and
appropriate food. As a matter of course mothers with imperfect
teeth, or weak stomachs, cannot perform the digestion of
extra food for the infant so well as those mothers who have
an abundance of reserve power in their digestive apparatus;
and with such patients, the question arises, how are they to
make up for the deficiency which they soon experience in <a name="Page_238t" id="Page_238t"></a><a href="#Page_238tn">the</a>
supply of milk? Such mothers appeal to their medical
advisers to prescribe some stimulant which will enable them to
overcome the difficulty which they experience, and often are
greatly dissatisfied if informed that there is no drug in the
<i>materia medica</i> which will make up for structural weakness in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>the organs which masticate, digest or assimilate the food.
The proper course for such women to adopt is a simple and
rational one. They should assist their digestive apparatus as
much as possible by securing an abundance of suitable and
nutritious food, prepared in the best way, and as is most digestible,
while they should lessen the demands of their own system
by the avoidance of bodily fatigue, and mental excitement.
These means, aided by that philosophical hygiene which is at
all times essential to the preservation of pure and perfect
health, will enable them to supply a maximum quantity of pure
and wholesome milk; and further calls by the child require
proper artificial food. Unfortunately such advice fails to
satisfy many anxious mothers who refuse to admit, or believe,
that they are less robust, or less capable, than other ladies of
their acquaintance, and such mothers fall easy victims to circulars
vaunting the nourishing properties of ‘Hoare’s Stout,’
‘Tanqueray’s Gin,’ or Gilbey’s ‘strengthening Port,’ circulars
which are always backed up by the example, and advice, of
lady friends, who themselves have acquired the habit of using
these liquors, and who view as a reproach to themselves the
practice of any other lady who may not keep them in countenance,
as the perfection of all moral and physical propriety.
Unfortunately the pressure of such lady friends is often so
persistent as to paralyse the influence of a conscientious and
thoughtful medical adviser, while the appetites and beliefs of
such friends often throw them into active antagonism to any
medical adviser, who may not endorse the habits in which, as
they believe, and no doubt conscientiously, duty to their child
requires them to indulge. The only course that a medical
practitioner, whose family is dependent upon his practice, can
safely take with veteran mothers on this question, is to let them
have their own way without reiterated admonition. When
once they have acquired the habit of depending upon large
quantities of beer for nursing their children, they become perfectly
infatuated, and are practically incapable of passing
through the probationary fortnight which takes place before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>the digestive apparatus can work under its natural, but to them
strange, conditions, while the temporary longing for beer, and
the sudden lessening of the quantity of milk afforded by their
strained and impoverished systems, are at once set down as clear
proofs that their medical adviser is a crochetty, and dangerous
person, who must be superseded at the first convenient opportunity.
Facts and arguments have no more influence on such
mothers than they have upon opium-eaters, drunkards, or
inveterate consumers of tobacco; while the extreme propriety
of conduct which these ladies manifest, and the encouragement
they receive from other medical men, make the convictions
based upon their own personal sensations incontrovertible, and
their position practically unassailable. I think I might fairly say
that among the comfortable middle classes of society the views
at present held on this question are so deplorable that a large
proportion of children are never sober from the first moment of
their existence until they have been weaned; while often after a
few years the use of alcohol is again introduced to the children
as a ‘medical comfort,’ as a part of their regular diet, or as an
invariable accompaniment of all their juvenile visitation, and
company-keeping. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising
that temperance reformers appeal in vain on this question,
and that their facts and arguments are viewed with
plausible indifference, or insidious opposition, by persons whose
appetites and instincts have been undergoing debasement, and
perversion from the very dawn of their lives. My own deliberate
conviction is that nothing but harm comes to nursing
mothers, and to the infants who are dependent upon them, by
the ordinary use of alcoholic beverages of any kind.</p>

<p>“Infants nursed by mothers who drink much beer also become
fatter than usual, and to an untrained eye sometimes appear
as ‘magnificent children.’ But the fatness of such children
is not a recommendation to the more knowing observer; they
are extremely prone to die of inflammation of the chest (bronchitis)
after a few days’ illness from an ordinary cold. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>die, very much more frequently than other children, of convulsions
and diarrhœa, while cutting their teeth, and they are very
liable to die of scrofulous inflammation of the membranes of the
brain, commonly called ‘water on the brain,’ while their childhood
often presents a painful contrast&mdash;in the way of crooked
legs, and stunted or ill-shapen figure&mdash;to the ‘magnificent,’ and
promising appearance of their infancy.</p>

<p>“Those ladies who adopt the general views I have thus
expressed in relation to the nursing of their children, will
want to know what is the ‘proper artificial food’ with which
to supplement their milk when it is deficient in quantity. With
some patients the milk will fall off in quantity at the end of two
or three months. With others, although the quantity may not
fall off, the child seems unsatisfied; and there is a third class
with whom a profusion of milk is supplied, and the child thrives
exceedingly, but the mother gets flabby, weak, nervous, pale and
exhausted. In the last case, the mother is simply goaded on
by susceptibility of her nervous system, or by inordinate activity
of the breasts to yield an amount of milk which her digestive
powers are not equal to providing for. The treatment of such
cases should be simply repressive. The mother should separate
herself somewhat more from the child, and make a rule of only
nursing it from five to eight times in the twenty-four hours,
while the neck of the mother should be kept cool in regard to
dress, and cold sponging may be practiced carefully night and
morning. Her attention should be diverted by outdoor exercise
on foot, and additionally in a carriage if necessary. When
the mother’s milk, though apparently not deficient in quantity,
proves unsatisfying to the child, great attention should be paid
to varying the diet of the mother, while such staple foods should
be taken as are most easily and thoroughly assimilated into milk.
The unsatisfying quality of the milk will generally be remedied
by taking a more varied diet, together with three or four half
pints of milk in the course of the day, accompanied with farinaceous
matter, as in the shape of well-made milk gruel; and in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>case these measures fail, the only alternative is to supplement
the mother’s milk by obtaining a wet-nurse to suckle the child
three or four times a day alternately with the mother, or by
feeding the child with proper artificial food. The same measures
may be resorted to where the milk, though satisfying in
character, is deficient in quantity; and in preparing artificial
food for the child it must always be remembered that the food
requires to be adapted to the stage of development which is
manifested by a young infant’s digestive organs. The infant’s
digestive apparatus is, in fact, designed to digest milk, and to
digest nothing else, but when the teeth are cut farinaceous matter
of a more or less solid character should be gradually mixed
with the milk. Almost all the illnesses of infants under twelve
months of age are caused by some gross impropriety of diet, or
otherwise, on the part of the mother, for which the child suffers
through the medium of the milk, or they are caused by feeding
the child with improper artificial food. Thick sop, and many
other articles often given as food are as indigestible to an infant
of three months old as beefsteaks would be to a horse; and, until
the child has cut its teeth, it should have nothing but food
resembling the mother’s milk as closely as possible.</p>

<p>“The proper way to feed an infant of three months old,
whose mother is only able to partially support it, is as follows:
When the child wakes in the morning it should not go to the
mother, but should be taken away by the nurse, and immediately
fed from the bottle, sucking its milk through a suitable
teat. After the mother has breakfasted the child may go to the
breast, and during the day it should be alternately fed from the
bottle, and nursed by the mother. At six o’clock the baby
should invariably be placed in its crib, by the side of the mother’s
bed, and fed just before going to sleep, and the habit of
going to bed at six o’clock should be strictly and invariably enforced.
If once the child be allowed to come down to the family
circle after dark, the habit of going to sleep will be broken,
and the child will continuously cry to come down. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>course of the evening the mother may nurse the child once, and
at ten or eleven o’clock, when the mother goes to bed, the child
should be again fed from the bottle, and the mother should have
a basin of well-made milk-gruel; and by her bedside should be
placed, at the last moment, as much gruel as she is likely to
drink with relish during the night. Whenever the child is
restless it should be taken out of its crib, gently, by the mother,
and nursed, say two or three times during the night, and put
back again into its crib, the child never being allowed to sleep
with the mother. When the night is fairly over, and the child
awakens, it should be fetched by the nurse, and have its first
morning meal from the bottle. This plan of feeding should be
persisted in continuously until the child has cut its teeth; and it
is only when every means have been taken to ensure the sweetness,
freshness and niceness, not only of the milk and water,
but of the bottle and of the teat, and the child still fails to get
on, that, in rare cases, I advise the admixture of a little farinaceous
matter, in the way of food containing one part milk, and
two parts of properly sweetened barley-water. As the milk
teeth come through, other farinaceous matter may be gradually
blended with the milk, and there is nothing better than to begin
at about eight months with a teaspoonful of baked flour,
well boiled in a pint of milk and water, or in the water, to be
afterwards cooled with milk. Oftentimes a little salt, as well as
sugar, will materially help its digestion. The child will do well
on that food&mdash;the quantity being duly increased&mdash;until it has
cut almost all its milk teeth, when it may eat bread and butter,
rice, and egg puddings, and occasionally eat a boiled egg once
a day. I believe that it is a great mistake to give red flesh meat
to children in their early years, unless there be some very special
reason for it, and then it should only be temporarily used; but
nice potatoes, flavored with fresh gravy from a joint, may be
given at dinner, as the child becomes able to feed itself. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Bear in mind that when you take wine, beer or brandy, you
are distilling that wine, beer or brandy into your child’s body.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Probably nothing could be worse than to have the very fabric of
the child’s tissues laid down from alcoholized blood.”</p></div>

<p>Another English physician deplores “the pernicious
habit of drinking large quantities of ale or stout
by nursing mothers, under the idea that they thereby
increase and improve the secretion of milk, whereas
they are in reality deteriorating the quality of that
upon which the infant must depend for health and
life.”</p>

<p>Dr. Edis says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Infant mortality is mainly due to two causes, the substitution
of farinaceous food for milk, and the delusion that ale or
beer is necessary as an article of diet for nursing mothers. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Countless disorders among infants are due simply and solely
to the popular fallacy, that the nursing mother cannot properly
fulfil her duties, unless she resorts to the aid of alcoholics.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The opinion prevails quite extensively among certain classes
of people, and with some physicians, that a liberal use of beer
is beneficial to women while nursing their children. They
drink it under the impression that it will both strengthen them
and make their milk more abundant. But I have never seen a
case in which it had been used regularly for any considerable
period of time, where it did not result in more or less indigestion
from gastric irritation and disordered secretions, and an
early failure in the secretion of milk. It probably never increases
the flow of milk any more than would the drinking of
the same quantity of pure water; while the alcohol it contains,
by daily repetition, induces congestion of the gastric mucous
membrane, with disordered gastric and hepatic secretions.</p>

<p>“A case strikingly illustrating these results was examined by
me to-day. The patient was a young married woman who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>nursing her first child, now nine months old. At the time of
her confinement she was in fair health, rather nervous temperament,
weight 120 pounds. During the first few days her milk
did not flow very freely, and she says her physician advised her
to drink beer. Consequently she commenced to drink a glass
of beer at each mealtime, and a bottle during the night. During
the first six months she had sufficient milk for her baby;
but before the end of that time she had begun to suffer from
flatulency, constipation, gaseous and acid eructations, what she
calls ‘heart-burn,’ and sometimes vomiting. During the last
three months she has suffered, in addition to the preceding
symptoms, one or two attacks each week of extreme pain, from
the lower point of the sternum to the back between the scapula,
accompanied by retching, or severe efforts to vomit. To relieve
these attacks she has taken liberal doses of gin, in addition to
her regular supply of beer. Now at the end of nine months,
her milk has nearly ceased to flow, her bowels are costive, her
stomach tolerates only small quantities of the simplest nourishment,
her flesh and strength are very much reduced, her weight
being only 96 pounds; and yet she thinks both the beer and gin
make her feel better every time she takes them. Such is the
delusive power of the anæsthetic effect of alcohol. A persistence
in the same management would probably terminate fatally
in from six to twelve months more, from chronic gastritis, and
inanition. But if she will rigidly abstain from all alcoholic remedies,
and take only the most bland, unirritating nourishment,
aided by mildly soothing and antiseptic remedies, and fresh air,
she will slowly recover.”</p></div>

<p>In a clinical lecture delivered before the Senior
Class in the Northwestern University Medical
School, Dr. Davis told of a case similar to the preceding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The flow of milk in her breasts has also diminished to such
a degree that she does not have half enough for her baby. Yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>she says the <i>beer</i> makes her feel better after each drink, and
that the <i>gin</i> helps to relieve the severe attacks of pain, and
consequently she thinks she could not do without them. It is
undoubtedly true that the patient feels temporary relief from
the anæsthetic effect of the alcohol in her beer and gin, just as
she would from any anæsthetic or narcotic. And it is equally
true that so long as the alcohol is present in her blood it so
modifies the hemoglobin and albuminous constituents, as to
diminish the reception and internal distribution of oxygen, and
thereby retards metabolic changes. But the combined influence
of the alcohol in retarding the internal distribution of oxygen and
the drain upon the nutritive elements of her blood, in furnishing
milk for her baby, led to rapid impoverishment of the blood and
tissues, and the early establishment of a sufficient grade of gastritis
to cause indigestion, frequent vomiting, and, later, paroxysms
of severe gastralgia, with general emaciation, and loss of
strength.</p>

<p>“In accordance with the present popular ideas, both in and
out of the profession, this patient tells me she has tried a great
variety of foods, peptonized, sterilized, and predigested, but all
to no purpose. And why?&mdash;Simply because her troubles are
not in the kind of food she takes, but in the morbid condition of
her blood, and of the mucous membrane and nerves of her
stomach. Consequently the rational indications for treatment
are: (<i>a</i>) to get her stomach and blood free from the alcohol of
beer and gin; (<i>b</i>) to encourage the reception and internal distribution
of oxygen by plenty of fresh air; (<i>c</i>) to give her the
most bland, or unirritating food in small, and frequently repeated
doses, of which good milk with lime-water, and milk and wheat-flour
gruel are the best; (<i>d</i>) such medicines as possess sufficient
antiseptic, and anodyne properties to allay the irritability
of the gastric mucous membrane, and lessen fermentation.”</p></div>

<h3>COMPARATIVE DEATH-RATES WITH AND WITHOUT
THE USE OF ALCOHOL AS A REMEDY.</h3>


<p>A study of statistics relating to the difference
in results of the treatment of disease with and
without the use of alcohol, cannot but be of great
interest to all students of the alcohol question.
The appended statistics are culled mainly from the
<i>Medical Pioneer</i> of England, now, <i>Medical Temperance
Review</i>, the journal of the British Medical Temperance
Association, and from the <i>Bulletin of the
American Medical Temperance Association</i>.</p>

<p>A paragraph in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, for
Dec. 2, 1893, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“An interesting fact has been noted by Dr. Claye Shaw, at
the London County Asylum, Banstead, for the Insane. Since
the withdrawal of <i>beer</i> from the dietary, the rate of recovery
has gone up. During the past year, for example, the recoveries
reached 46.97 per cent. Nearly one half of the patients had
thus recovered during the period stated. The inmates take
their food better without the liquor, and they are thus taught
that intoxicants are not a necessity of ordinary health.”</p></div>

<p>In the <i>Medical Pioneer</i> for January, 1894, Dr. John
Mois, medical superintendent of West Haven Infec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>tious
Diseases Hospital, states that prior to 1885 he
had treated 2,148 cases of smallpox “in the usual
routine method, with the use of alcohol when the
heart’s action seemed to indicate it;” resulting in a
mortality of 17 per cent. But since 1885 he has
treated 700 additional cases under similar circumstances
except that the use of alcoholic preparations
was entirely omitted, and the resulting mortality
was only 11 per cent.</p>

<p>In the same journal, Dr. J. J. Ridge states that
he had treated the 200 cases of scarlet fever admitted
into the Enfield Isolation Hospital during
the years 1892 and 1893, without alcohol in any
form, with a mortality of only 2.5 per cent.; while
the mortality in the hospitals under the Metropolitan
Asylums Board in 1893, in which alcohol was
used in accordance with the usual practice in scarlet
fever, was 6.3 per cent.</p>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge says later:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In January, 1894, I published the result of the treatment of
the first 200 cases of scarlatina admitted into the temporary
wards of the Enfield Isolation Hospital during 1892 and 1893.
I stated that there had been five fatal cases, but that one was
dying when admitted and only lived a few hours. The
mortality was 2 per cent., or 2.5 if the later case is included.</p>

<p>“Since then 300 more cases have been admitted and discharged
and among these there have been 7 fatal. Hence there
have been 14 deaths in 500 consecutive cases extending over a
period of a little more than four years. One of these ought
to be excluded, no time having been given for treatment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Hence the mortality has been just 2.6 per cent. This, I think
it will be admitted, is a low mortality, although it is possible it
may be even lower when the cases are treated in a permanent
hospital about to be erected.</p>

<p>“It may be interesting to state that 4 of the cases died on
the third day after admission; 1 on the fourth; 1 on the sixth;
1 on the tenth, with pneumonia; 1 on the thirteenth; 1 on the
fifteenth; 1 on the sixteenth; 1 on the eighteenth; 1 on the
thirty-sixth, with nephritis and pleuropneumonia; and 1 on the
forty-sixth, with otitis and meningitis.</p>

<p>“All the cases have been treated without alcohol either as
food or drug, although many have been of great severity with
various complications. It is certain that the absence of alcohol
has not been detrimental, since the mortality is less than three-fourths
of that of the mortality among all notified cases in England
and Wales. I am bound to say that it is my firm conviction
that had alcohol been given in the usual fashion, the
death-rate would have been higher. Cases have been admitted
to which alcohol has been given previous to admission, apparently
with harm, as they have improved without it. One case
was particularly noticeable in this respect. A child, aged 6,
had had a good deal of whisky, and was supposed to be dying
when admitted on the fourth day of the disease, so that the
doctor who had seen it was surprised, when he called the following
day to inquire, to find it was still alive. Without a
drop of alcohol it began to improve and made a good recovery.
I may say that delirium is very rare, even in the worst cases
treated non-alcoholically.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Norman Kerr says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In my paper on ‘The Medical Administration of Alcohol,’
read to the section of medicine at the Sheffield meeting in 1876,
I cited several medical testimonies in favor of non-alcoholic
treatment of fevers, notably that of my friend, the late Dr.
Simon Nicolls, who had a mortality of less than 5 per cent. in
230 cases.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>“The record of the results of a greatly lessened administration
of alcohol in the treatment of smallpox in the London hospital
ships, is of deep interest. Having been requested to inquire
into the effects of this diminished alcoholic stimulation on mortality
and convalescence, Dr. Birdwood stated that though the
gravity of the cases had increased, with a mortality of 15 per
100 in the metropolis, the ship’s death-rate had remained at
less than 7 per 100. Convalescence had been more rapid, and
there had been fewer and less serious complications from abscesses
and inflammatory boils. Other causes had contributed
to this improvement, but the medical officers attributed a considerable
share in the amelioration to a greatly diminished prescription
of alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Medical Pioneer</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In 1872 there appeared in the <i>Saturday Review</i> an article
in which the medical practitioners of this country were accused
of inciting their patients to free drinking, and in the discussion
which this article called forth, Dr. Gairdner, of Glasgow, said
that fever patients in that city, when treated with milk and
without alcohol, did much better than those reported as having
been treated by Dr. Todd with large doses of alcohol; the
latter resulting in a mortality of about 25 per cent., while those
treated by Dr. Gairdner with milk had had a death-rate of
only 12 per cent. About this time the British Medical Temperance
Association was founded, owing to the exertions of
Dr. Ridge, of Enfield, and in 1876 it was enrolled, under the
presidency of Sir B. W. Richardson. It now contains 269
members in England and Wales, 53 in Scotland and 80 in Ireland,
or more than 400 altogether, all professional men and
women. This, I think, is but a sign of the change of opinion
on the use of alcoholic fluids in medical practice, for all who remember
what medical practice was in London thirty years ago
know that the use of wine and brandy in hospital practice was
so common that it was quite a rarity in some hospitals to find a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>patient who was not ordered, by some of the staff, from three
to four ounces of brandy or six to eight fluid ounces of wine.
The expense caused to the hospitals by this practice was, of
course, great, and increased notably between 1852 and 1872,
owing to the prevalence of the views of Liebig and his follower,
Dr. Todd. The writings of Parkes, Gairdner, Dr. Norman
Kerr and of Sir B. Ward Richardson, Dr. Morton and others,
gradually lessened this predilection for treating diseases by alcohol,
and accordingly between 1872 and 1882 a great change
came over the practice of London hospitals. Thus the sum
paid for milk in 1852 in Saint Bartholomew’s Hospital was
£684, and in 1882 it was £2,012; whilst alcohol in that hospital
cost in 1852, £406; in 1862, £1,446; in 1872, £1,446; and in
1882 only £653. Westminster Hospital in 1882 spent £137 on
alcohol and £500 on milk. One hospital, St. George’s, long
continued to use large quantities of alcohol. That hospital in
1872 had the high mortality among its typhoid fever patients of
24 per cent., which was twice as high as that noted by Dr.
Gairdner as occurring in Glasgow, when alcohol was abandoned
and milk used instead. Dr. Meyer, who reported these
cases of typhoid treated in Saint George’s Hospital at that time,
mentioned that alcohol in large doses was given to 87 per cent.
of the patients. Three-fifths of these patients took daily eight
ounces of brandy when there was danger of sinking from failure
of the heart’s action. One-fourth of the number took sixteen
fluid ounces of brandy in the 24 hours.”</p>

<p>“In 230 typhoid cases in St. Mary’s Hospital, Dr. Chambers
reduced the ratio of deaths from 1 in 5 with alcohol to 1 in 40
without it. Dr. Perry, of Glasgow, found that of 534 cases
treated with alcohol, 138 died, while of 491 treated without alcohol,
only 9 died.”</p></div>

<p>In a recent text-book on medicine occurs the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“English physicians use spirits in fevers, and all experience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>sustains the conviction that no substitute has been found for
them.”</p></div>

<p>In a late number of the <i>Temperance Record</i>, Dr.
Smith gives a different view of the experience of
English physicians:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When Bentley Todd was at King’s College, and leading
his profession, brandy was the rule in febrile cases. Then the
mortality varied from twenty-five to thirty-five per cent.
That the treatment was as fatal as the disease, experience
demonstrates:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. Professor W. T. Gairdner, of Glasgow, writing to the
Lancet (1864), gave his experience as follows:&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>“3. Dr. J. C. Pearson writes to the <i>Lancet</i> (Dec. 5 and 26,

hundreds of cases without a single death, and never prescribed
stimulants in any shape or form in the disease.</p>

result of the experience there gained, entire modification. The
conviction became forced upon my mind that in no case in
which it was used did benefit to the patient ensue; that in a
proportion of cases its use was distinctly hurtful; and that in a
small but appreciable number of cases the resultant harm was
sufficient to tilt the balance as against the recovery of the
patient.’</p>

patients. Dr. Bond’s figures are:&mdash;</p>

<p>In May, 1890, Dr. Nathan S. Davis, read a paper
before the American Medical Association upon the
use of certain drugs in disease. Among the drugs
mentioned was alcohol, and comparative death-rates
were given in typhoid fever and pneumonia, between
Mercy Hospital, Chicago, during a term of
years when no alcohol was used in the medical
wards, Dr. Davis being in charge of them, and
some of the large metropolitan hospitals using alcohol.
In Mercy Hospital without alcohol, the death-rate
in typhoid fever was only five per cent.; in
pneumonia only twelve per cent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Of 161 cases of typhoid fever treated in Cook County Hospital
during 1889, 27 died, or one in six&mdash;nearly 17 per cent.</p>

<p>“According to the annual report of the Cincinnati Hospital
for 1886, 47 cases of typhoid fever were treated during that
year, with seven deaths, a mortality rate of 16 per cent.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Garfield Memorial Hospital, at Washington, reported for
the year 1889, 22 cases of typhoid fever, with 5 deaths&mdash;or 22
per cent.</p>

<p>“In the Pennsylvania Hospital the mortality rate in pneumonia
for the years 1884-1886, was 34 per cent.</p>

<p>“The mortality of pneumonia in the Massachusetts General
Hospital, between the years 1822 and 1889, comprising 1,000
cases, was 25 per cent.; but a gradual increase in mortality had
been noted from 10 per cent. in the first decade of the seventy
years represented by this report, to 28 per cent. in the last
decade.</p>

<p>“According to the report of the Supervising Surgeon General
of the U.S. Marine Hospital Service for 1888, the number of
cases of pneumonia treated between 1880 and 1887 was 1,649,
with 311 deaths&mdash;nearly 19 per cent.</p>

<p>“The Cincinnati Hospital reported for 1886 a mortality rate
in pneumonia of 38 per cent.</p>

<p>“The mortality rate in the Cook County Hospital, Chicago,
for 1889, according to Dr. Heltoin, relating to 80 cases of pneumonia,
was 36 per cent.”</p></div>

<p>Only a five per cent. death-rate in typhoid fever
without alcohol, and from sixteen to twenty-two
per cent. with alcohol; only a twelve per cent. death-rate
in pneumonia without alcohol, and from 19 to
as high as 38 per cent. with alcohol. Such are the
comparative death-rates given by Dr. Davis. They
should be committed to memory by every opposer
of the use of alcohol, as they show clearly that
people have many more chances for recovery, other
things being equal, in the diseases mentioned, if
alcohol is not used than if it is.</p>

<p>It is worthy of mention in this connection that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>Cook County Hospital contains in its report for
1897 the following items: Number of patients
19,536; cost of liquors $80.00; per cent. of deaths
from all causes, 5.7. The cost of liquors is only
.004 for each patient. This shows a decided advance
in the disuse of alcohol, when so very little is
used in a great hospital, with so large a number of
patients.</p>

<p>Dr. A. L. Loomis, in the <a name="Page_255t" id="Page_255t"></a><a href="#Page_255tn">treatment</a> of 600 typhus
fever cases on Blackwell’s Island in 1864, excluded
alcoholics, with the result of reducing the mortality
rate to only six per cent. whereas it had previously
been twenty-two per cent., in Bellevue Hospital
from which the patients had been removed.</p>

<p>In Battle Creek Sanitarium no alcohol is used in
any disease, simply because the management believe
better results are obtained by the use of other
agencies. In the October, (1893) number of the
<i>American Medical Temperance Quarterly</i> now <i>Bulletin
of the A. M. T. A.</i>, Dr. J. H. Kellogg gives
statistics of deaths from various diseases in the Battle
Creek Sanitarium. The total of these statistics
is as follows: la grippe, 827 cases, 4 deaths&mdash;or two
per cent.; scarlet fever, 83 cases, 2 deaths&mdash;less
than three per cent.; 333 cases of typhoid fever, 9
deaths&mdash;or 2.7 per cent.; 82 cases of pneumonia, 4
deaths&mdash;or 4.9 per cent. These exceptional results
are not attributed solely to the non-use of alcohol.
The nursing and surroundings were of the best.
But these results certainly show that the use of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>alcohol as a remedy in acute diseases is not necessary,
and that patients have a much better chance
for life, other things being equal, where alcohol is
not used than where it is.</p>

<p>Dr. Kellogg says of the surgical cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In a hospital of 100 beds, connected with the institution,
more than 3,000 surgical cases have been treated, to whom alcohol
has never been administered except in connection with
chloroform anæsthesia; my uniform custom being to administer
an ounce of brandy or whisky five minutes before beginning
the administration of the anæsthetic, when chloroform is used.</p>

<p>“The surgical cases include more than 300 cases of ovariotomy,
and over 300 other cases involving the peritoneal cavity, such as
operations for strangulated hernia, the radical cure of hernia,
etc. The statistics of death and recoveries are certainly as
good as can be produced by any hospital in the world, dealing
with the same class of cases. The total mortality from the
operation of ovariotomy, including nearly 300 cases, is less than
three per cent., and for the last few years, in which the antiseptic
measures have been perfected, the record is still better,
showing a succession of 172 cases of laparotomy for the removal
of ovarian tumors, or diseased uterus and ovaries, without
a death. These cases include a number of <a name="Page_256t" id="Page_256t"></a><a href="#Page_256tn">hysterectomies</a>,
and many cases so desperate that those who trust in alcohol as
a heart stimulant, and as a means of supporting the vital energies,
would certainly have considered it necessary to resort to
the use of this drug. Nevertheless, it was not administered in
a single case, and I have seen no reason to regret its non-use
in a single instance.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers, of Hartford, Conn., tells the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In a large hospital a study of the mortality of pneumonia
indicated a greater fatality at intervals of six months. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>were five per cent. more deaths during periods of two months
at a time, twice during the year. This extended back for two
years, and was finally narrowed down to the service of an eminent
physician who gave spirits freely in all cases of pneumonia
from their entrance to the hospital. The other visiting physicians
gave very little spirits, and only in the later stages. The
physician was skeptical of these statistics, but finally consented
to test them by giving up spirits practically in all cases of pneumonia.
This was continued for a year, and the mortality went
back to the average statistics. That physician has abandoned
alcohol as a food and a medicine, only in very limited degree.
He writes, ‘My stupidity in accepting theories and statements
of others, concerning spirits, which I could have tested personally,
is a source of deep sorrow, and I do not know but it could
be called criminal. I certainly feel that punishment would be
just.<a name="Page_257t" id="Page_257t"></a><a href="#Page_257tn">’”</a></p></div>

<p>Brandy has been considered the great necessity
in cholera, yet the use of it and other alcoholics are
known to expose people to greater danger when
this disease prevails.</p>

<p>The <i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i> is authority
for the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“During the epidemic of 1832, Dr. Bronson said: ‘In Montreal
1,000 persons have died of cholera, only two of whom
were teetotalers.’ A Montreal paper said: ‘Not a drunkard
who has been attacked has recovered from the disease, and almost
all the victims have been at least moderate drinkers.’</p>

<p>“In Albany, N. Y., the same year, cholera carried off 366 persons
above sixteen years of age, all but four of whom belonged
to the drinking classes. Packer, Prentice &amp; Co., large furriers
in Albany, employed 400 persons, none of whom used ardent
spirits, and there were only two cases of cholera among them.
Mr. Delevan, a contractor, said: ‘I was engaged at the time in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>erecting a large block of buildings. The laborers were much
alarmed, and were on the point of abandoning the work. They
were advised to stay and give up strong drink. They all remained,
and all quit the use of strong drink except one, and he
fell a victim to the disease.’ He says also: ‘I had a gang of
diggers in a clay bank, to whom the same proposition was
made; they all agreed to it, and not one died. On the opposite
side of the same clay bank were other diggers who continued
their regular rations of whisky, and one third of them died.’</p>

<p>“In New York City there were 204 cases in the park, only six
of whom were temperate, and these recovered, while 122 of the
others died. In many parts of the city the saloon keepers saw
and acknowledged the terrible connection between their business
and the spread of the disease, and, becoming alarmed for
their own safety, shut up their saloons and fled, saying: ‘The
way from the saloon to hell is too short.’</p>

<p>“In Washington the Board of Health was so impressed with
the terrible facts that they declared the grog shops nuisances,
ordered them closed, and they remained closed for three months.</p>

<p>“A prominent physician of Glasgow reported: ‘Only nineteen
per cent. of the temperate perished, while ninety-one and
two-tenths per cent. of the intemperate died.’ One extensive
liquor dealer of Glasgow, said, ‘Cholera has carried off half of
my customers.’</p>

<p>“In Warsaw ninety per cent. of those who died from cholera
were wine drinkers.</p>

<p>“At Tifels, Prussia, a town of 20,000 inhabitants, every drunkard
died of cholera.”</p></div>

<p>The <i>St. Paul Medical Journal</i>, of September,
1899, gives the following report of a railway surgeon,
Dr. Kane:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“From June 1, 1898, to June 1, 1899, the author performed a
few more than four hundred operations. Forty-nine abdomi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>nal
sections, fifty odd more operations of a graver sort, one
hundred miscellaneous of less gravity than above, over one
hundred operations upon female perineum and uterus. Of the
four hundred, more than three hundred demanded anæsthesia.
There were but three deaths, making the mortality a little less
than one per cent.</p>

<p>“The author does not claim a phenomenally low mortality, nor
does he claim specially brilliant results. He has to contend
with unreasoning fear on the part of the patients for hospital
surgeons, and also most of his cases had been in the hands
of quacks, and had subjected themselves to remedies prescribed
by old women. Many cases came after the family physician
had exhausted his resources. He thinks his results are considerably
better than the average in hospitals and in country
districts. Alcohol medication was dispensed with entirely
after the patients came under his care, and to this he attributes
much of his success. He does not believe that alcohol is a stimulant,
or a tonic. On the contrary, he believes that it retards
digestion, arrests secretion, and hinders excretion. The courage
and fortitude of his patients were lessened instead of increased
by the use of alcoholic medication.</p>

<p>“Pain is better borne, endured longer and more patiently
when alcohol is not used.</p>

<p>“He urges the practical surgeon to carefully weigh the subject
of alcohol, and verify for himself the expediency of its use.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. B. W. Richardson in the report of his practice
for 1895 in the London Temperance Hospital
refers to non-alcoholic treatment of rheumatism.
He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Out of seventy-one cases of acute or subacute rheumatism&mdash;the
large majority acute, and attended with temperatures
moving up to 104° F.&mdash;sixty-nine recovered, and two, although
they were discharged without being put on the recovery list,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>were so far relieved that a few days’ change in country air
seemed all that was required to induce full restoration. Comparing
the experience of the treatment of acute rheumatic disease
without alcohol with that which I have previously observed
with alcohol, I can have no hesitation in declaring that it
is of the greatest advantage to follow total abstinence absolutely
in this disease. The pain and swelling of joints is more
quickly relieved under abstinence, the fever falls more rapidly,
there is less frequent relapse, and there is quicker recovery.
In brief, the experience of <a name="Page_260t" id="Page_260t"></a><a href="#Page_260tn">treatment</a> of rheumatic fever minus
alcohol, presents to me as much novelty as it does pleasure,
and I am convinced that if any candid member of the profession
could have witnessed what I have witnessed in this matter,
he would agree with me that alcohol in rheumatic fever, however
acute, is altogether out of place. I am also under the
conviction, though I express it with great reserve, that in acute
rheumatism, treated without alcohol, the cardiac complications,
endocardial and pericardial, are much less frequently developed
than where alcohol is supplied.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Pechuman in <i>Alcohol&mdash;Is It a Medicine</i>, published
in 1891, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is no disputing that many deaths occur each day as
the result of the administration of alcohol in acute diseases, to
say nothing of the deaths caused by its habitual use; and those
who give it ignore the very fundamental principles of physiology
and the many published statistics. The Boston Hospital
report tells a sad story in this connection; it shows that
out of 1,042 cases treated with alcoholics 386 died, while out of
the same number treated without alcohol only 81 died. Using
plain English 305 were actually killed by it.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers, in the January, 1899, <i>Bulletin
of the American Medical Temperance Association</i>,
gave the following Hospital Statistics, showing a
decline in the use of spirits in hospitals:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Evidently a great change is going on in the use of alcohol
as a remedy in large hospitals. The annual reports of ten hospitals
in the New England and the Middle States show the
following widely varying figures. The spirits used include
beers, wines, whiskies and brandies, and vary from eleven to
sixty-one cents a person for all the cases treated. These hospitals
treat from eighty to seven hundred cases a year, both
surgical and medical, and the medical staff are the leading
physicians of the towns and cities where they are located. The
hospital where the largest amount of spirits was used is not
different from others, nor is the one where the lowest amount
is reported. The conclusion is that this difference is due
entirely to the judgment of the medical men. The lowest rate
(eleven cents each) was in a hospital where one hundred and
twenty-one cases had been under treatment. The highest
rate (sixty-one cents) was in a hospital of five hundred and
forty cases. The mortality from typhoid fever and pneumonia
was eight per cent. higher in this hospital than in the one
where only eleven cents a head had been expended for spirits.
The general mortality did not vary greatly in any of these hospitals,
and the records of one year could not be expected to
show this. In the remaining hospitals the mortality of the
fever and the septic cases was about the same. The free use
of spirits did not show any improvement, but rather an increase
of the death-rate, while the same amount of spirits used
showed but little change, and that in the line of improvement
of death-rate. These are only the figures of one year, but
they indicate a change of practice, and show the passing of
alcohol as a remedy.”</p></div>

<h3>REASONS WHY ALCOHOL IS DANGEROUS AS
MEDICINE.</h3>


<p>In the chapter upon “The Effects of Alcohol
upon the Human Body” are cited some of the
reasons assigned by scientific investigators for their
disuse of alcohol as a remedy in disease. In this
chapter the same may be briefly hinted at, while
others, some the results of quite recent research,
will be added.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i>, for January
1898, Dr. N. S. Davis says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The supposed effects of alcohol as a medicine were
originally based solely on the sensations and actions of the
patients taking it. The first appreciable effect of the alcohol
after entering the blood is that of an anæsthetic; that is, it
diminishes the sensibility of the brain and nerve structures, in
the same direction as ether and chloroform. And, as the brain
is the material seat of man’s consciousness, the alcohol renders
him less conscious of cold or heat, of weariness or pain, and
less conscious of his own weight or of any external resistance.
Consequently, when under the influence of small doses, he
feels lighter and less conscious of any external impressions,
and thinks he could do more than without it. It was these
effects that led both the patient and his physician to regard
the alcohol as a general stimulant or tonic, notwithstanding
the fact that by simply increasing the doses of alcohol the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>sensibility soon became entirely suspended, and the patient
helpless and altogether unconscious. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Simple increased frequency of the heart action is no evidence
of either increased force or efficiency in promoting the
circulation of the blood. Indeed, it may be stated as a physiological
law, that the more frequent the heart action above the
normal standard, the less efficiently does it promote the circulation
and strength of the living system. But the effect of a
moderate dose of alcohol in increasing the frequency of the
heart-beat and of blood pressure is so temporary that the doses
must be repeated so often that the alcohol accumulates in the
blood and tissues, and extends its paralyzing effects to all
the vasomotor, cardiac and respiratory nerves. Indeed, all
the investigators agree that alcohol in any dose capable of producing
an appreciable effect, diminishes the function of the
lungs in direct proportion to the quantity taken; and as the
lungs are the only channel through which free oxygen reaches
the blood, and such oxygen is the natural exciter of all vital
activities in the living body, it is not possible to explain how
alcohol, or any other drug that diminishes the function of the
lungs can, at the same time, act as a cardiac, or any other kind
of tonic.</p>

<p>“The truth is that all intelligent physicians and writers on
therapeutics of the present day agree in stating that alcohol in
large doses directly diminishes all the vital processes in the
living body, and in still larger doses suspends the life of the
individual by paralyzing the cerebral, vasomotor, respiratory
and cardiac functions, generally in the order named. If large
doses produce such effects, we must logically claim that small
doses act in the same direction, but in less degree. In other
words, alcohol is as truly and exclusively an anæsthetic as is
ether or chloroform, and, like them, is to be used as a medicine
only temporarily to relieve pain, or suspend nerve sensibility.
But as for these purposes it is less efficient than either
ether or chloroform, and other narcotics, there is no neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>sity
for using it as a remedy in the treatment of disease. And
in health its use in any dose can be productive of nothing but
injury. The only legitimate fields for the uses of alcohol are in
chemistry, pharmacy and the arts.”</p></div>

<p>In another issue of the same magazine, Dr. Davis
writes of the investigations pursued by M. Robin
of France in regard to the chemistry of respiration.
These investigations, he says, afford conclusive
proof that the acts of oxidation are defensive processes
of the organism in its struggle with bacteria,
and therefore that the physician should favor in
every possible way the absorption of oxygen in
every infection, especially when there are typhoid
complications.</p>

<p>He then speaks of the researches of other scientists
in the same line, concluding thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If we add to the foregoing investigations the results obtained
by Dr. A. C. Abbott, demonstrating that the presence of
alcohol directly diminished the vital resistance to infections,
we cannot fail to see that the administration of alcohol in
diphtheria, typhoid fever, pneumonia and other infectious
diseases, is directly contraindicated. If, as shown by M. Robin,
‘the acts of oxidation are defensive processes’ against bacterial
infections, then certainly the administration of alcohol to patients
with such infections is in the highest degree illogical and
injurious. The oxygen being obtained for oxidation purposes
in the blood and tissues, through the respiratory process, it
would be equally absurd to administer alcohol in all cases in
which it is desirable to increase the processes of oxidation, as a
long series of experiments has shown that the presence of
alcohol diminishes the efficiency of the respiratory process in
direct proportion to the quantity used.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>“How much longer will practical writers continue to recommend
for the same patient on the same day, fresh air, sponge
baths, and vasomotor and respiratory tonics to increase the
absorption of oxygen and oxidation processes, and alcohol in
the form of wine, whisky and brandy to directly diminish the
respiratory function and all the oxidations of the living system?”</p></div>

<p>In his address before the Medical Congress for
the Study of Alcohol, held at Prohibition Park,
Staten Island, July 15, 1891, Dr. Davis said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If the foregoing views regarding the effects of alcoholic
liquids on the human system in health, are correct, what can
we say concerning their value as remedies for the treatment of
disease? If it be true that the alcohol they contain acts directly
upon the corpuscular elements of the blood, and so far
diminishes the metabolic processes of nutrition and disintegration
as to lessen nerve sensibility and heat production, and favor
tissue degenerations, their rational application in the treatment
of any form of disease must be very limited. And yet the
same errors and delusions concerning their use in the treatment
of diseases and accidents are entertained and daily acted upon
by a large majority of medical men as are entertained by
the non-professional part of the public. Throughout the
greater part of our medical literature they are represented as
stimulating and restorative, capable of increasing the force and
efficiency of the circulation, and of conserving the normal living
tissues by diminishing their waste; and hence they are the first
to be resorted to in all cases of sudden exhaustion, faintness or
shock; the last to be given to the dying; and the most constant
remedies through the most important and protracted acute
general diseases. Indeed, it is this position and practice of the
profession that constitutes, at the present time, the strongest
influence in support of all the popular though erroneous and destructive
drinking customs of the people.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>“The same anæsthetic properties of the alcohol that render
the laboring man less <i>conscious</i> of the cold or heat or weariness,
also render the sick man less conscious of suffering, either
mental or physical, and thereby deceive both him and his
physician by the appearance, temporarily, of more comfort.
But if administered during the progress of fevers or acute
general disease, while it thus quiets the patient’s restlessness
and lessens his consciousness of suffering, it also directly diminishes
the vasomotor and excito-motor nerve forces with slight
reduction of temperature, and steadily diminishes both the
tissue metabolism and the excretory products, thereby favoring
the retention in the system of both the specific causes of disease
and the natural excretory materials which should have been
eliminated through the skin, lungs, kidneys and other glandular
organs. Although the immediate effect of the remedy is
thus to give the patient an appearance of more comfort, the
continued dulling or anæsthetic effect on the nervous centres,
the diminished oxygenation of the blood, and the continued
retention of morbitic and excretory products, all serve to protract
the disease, increase molecular degeneration, and add to
the number of fatal results.</p>

<p>“I am well aware that the foregoing views, founded on the
results of numerous and varied experimental researches and
well-known physiological laws, and corroborated by a wide
clinical experience, are in direct conflict with the very generally
accepted doctrine that alcohol is a cardiac tonic, capable of increasing
the force and efficiency of the circulation, and therefore
of great value in the treatment of the lower grades of
general fevers. But there have been many generally accepted
doctrines in the history of medicine that have been proved
fallacious. And the more recent experiments of Professors
Martin, Sidney Ringer, and Sainsbury, Reichert, H. C. Wood
and others, have clearly demonstrated that the presence of
alcohol in the blood as certainly diminishes the sensibility of
the vasomotor and cardiac nerves in proportion to its quantity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>until the heart stops, paralyzed, as that two and two make
four.</p>

<p>“After an ample clinical field of observation in both hospital
and private practice for more than fifty years, and a continuous
study of our medical literature, I am prepared to maintain the
position that the ratio of mortality from all the acute general
diseases has increased in direct proportion to the quantity of
alcoholic remedies administered during their treatment. How
can we reasonably expect any other result from the use of an
agent that so directly and uniformly diminishes the cerebral
respiratory, cardiac and metabolic functions of the living
human body?”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Medical Pioneer</i> of January, 1896, contained
a very interesting article by Dr. J. H. Kellogg upon
“The Influence of Alcohol upon Urinary Toxicity,
and its Relation to the Medical Use of Alcohol.”
He gives the results of many of his own experiments
to determine the effects of alcohol in hindering
the elimination of poisonous matter by the
kidneys. The subject of one experiment was a
healthy man of 30 years, weighing 66 kilos. For
fifty days prior to the experiment he had taken a
carefully regulated diet, and the urotoxic coefficient
had remained very nearly uniform. The urine carefully
collected for the first eight hours after the
administration of 8 ounces of brandy diluted with
water, showed an enormous diminution in the urotoxic
coefficient, which was, in fact, scarcely more
than half the normal coefficient for the individual
in question. The urine collected for the second
period of eight hours showed an increase of toxicity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>and that for the third period of eight hours showed
still further increase of toxicity, the coefficient having
nearly returned to its normal standard.</p>

<p>Of this Dr. Kellogg says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The bearing of this experiment upon the use of alcohol in
pneumonia, typhoid fever, erysipelas, cholera and other infectious
diseases, will be clearly seen. In all the maladies named,
and in nearly all other infectious diseases, which include the
greater number of acute maladies, the symptoms which give the
patient the greatest inconvenience, and those which have a fatal
termination, when such is the result, are directly attributable to
the influence of the toxic substances generated within the system
of the patient as the result of the specific microbes to which
the disease owes its origin. The activity of the liver in destroying
these poisons, and of the kidneys in eliminating them, are
the physiologic processes which stand between the patient and
death. In a very grave case of infectious disease, without this
destructive and eliminative activity the accumulation of poison
within the system would quickly reach a fatal point. The
symptoms of the patient vary for better or worse in relation to
the augmentation or diminution of the quantity of toxic substances
within the body.</p>

<p>“In view of these facts, is it not a pertinent question to ask
how alcohol can be of service in the treatment of such disorders
as pneumonia, typhoid fever, cholera, erysipelas and other infections,
since it acts in such a decided and powerful manner
in diminishing urinary toxicity&mdash;in other words, in lessening the
ability of the kidney to eliminate toxic substances? In infectious
diseases of every sort, the body is struggling under the
influence of toxic agents, the result of the action of microbes.
Alcohol is another toxic agent of precisely the same
origin. Like other toxins resulting from like processes of bacterial
growth, its influence upon the human organism is unfriendly;
it disturbs the vital processes; it disturbs every vital
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>function, and, as we have shown, in a most marked degree
diminishes the efficiency of the kidneys in the removal of the
toxins which constitute the most active factor in the diseases
named, and in others of analogous character. If a patient is
struggling under the influence of the pneumococcus, Eberth’s
bacillus, Koch’s cholera microbe or the pus-producing germs
which give rise to erysipelatous inflammation, his kidneys laboring
to undo, so far as possible, the mischief done by the invading
parasites, by eliminating the poisons formed by them, what
good could possibly be accomplished by the administration of a
drug, one of the characteristic effects of which is to diminish
renal activity, thereby diminishing also the quantity of poisons
eliminated through this channel? Is not such a course in the
highest degree calculated to add fuel to the flame? Is it not
placing obstacles in the way of the vital forces which are already
hampered in their work by the powerfully toxic agents to
the influence of which they are subjected?</p>

<p>“In his address before the American Medical Association
at Milwaukee, Dr. Ernest Hart, editor of the <i>British
Medical Journal</i>, very aptly suggested in relation to the treatment
of cholera, the inutility of alcohol, basing his suggestion
upon the fact that in a case of cholera, the system of the patient
is combating the specific poison which is the product of
the microbe of this disease, and hence is not likely to be
aided by the introduction of a poison produced by another
microbe; namely, alcohol. This logic seems very sound, and
the facts in relation to the influence of alcohol upon urinary toxicity
or renal activity, which are elucidated by our experiment,
fully sustain this observation of Mr. Hart.</p>

<p>“In a recent number of the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, Dr.
Lauder Brunton, the eminent English physiologist and neurologist,
in mentioning the fact that death from chloroform anæsthesia
rarely occurs in India, but is not infrequent in England,
attributed the fact to the meat-eating habits of the English people,
the natives of India being almost strictly vegetarian in diet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>partly from force of circumstances doubtless, but largely also,
no doubt, as the result of their religious belief, the larger proportion
of the population being more or less strict adherents to
the doctrines of Buddha, which strictly prohibit the use of flesh
foods.</p>

<p>“The theory advanced by Dr. Lauder Brunton in relation to
death from chloroform poisoning, is that the patient does not
die directly from the influence of chloroform upon the nerve
centres, but that death is due to the influence of chloroform
upon the kidneys, whereby the elimination of the ptomaines and
leucomaines naturally produced within the body, ceases, their
destruction by the liver also ceasing, so that the system is suddenly
overwhelmed by a great quantity of poison, and succumbs
to its influence, its power of resistance being lessened by the inhalation
of the chloroform.</p>

<p>“The affinity between alcohol and chloroform is very great.
Both are anæsthetics. Both chloroform and alcohol are simply
different compounds of the same radical, and the results of our
experiment certainly suggest the same thought as that expressed
by Dr. Brunton. How absurd, then, is the administration of
alcohol in conditions in which the highest degree of kidney
activity is required for the elimination of toxic agents!</p>

<p>“In a certain proportion of chronic cases there is a tendency
to tissue degeneration. Modern investigations have given good
ground for the belief that these degenerations are the result of
the influence of ptomaines, leucomaines and other poisons produced
within the body, upon the tissues. It is well known that
many of these toxic agents, even in very small quantity give
rise to degenerations of the kidney. It is this fact which explains
the occurrence of nephritis in connection with diphtheria,
scarlet fever and other infectious maladies. Dana has called
attention to the probable role played by ptomaines produced in
the alimentary canal in the development of organic disease of
the central nervous system.</p>

<p>“It is thus apparent that the integrity of the renal functions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>is a matter of as great importance in chronic as in acute disease,
hence any agent which diminishes the efficiency of these
organs in ridding the system of poisons, either those normally
and regularly produced, or those of an accidental or unusual
character, must be pernicious and dangerous in use.”</p></div>

<p>Among the more recent findings of science in
regard to the effects of alcohol are the action of
this drug upon the leucocytes or “guardian cells”
of the body. Leucocytes are defined to be “minute,
nucleated, colorless masses of protoplasm, capable
of ameboid movements, found swimming freely in
blood and lymph, in the reticulum of lymphatic
glands, and in bone-marrow and other connective
tissue.” The white corpuscles of the blood are leucocytes.
“The work of these cells is to prey upon
and take into their substance bacteria and other
micro-organisms within the blood and tissues.
This destruction of bacteria, and other noxious
organisms, has the biological name of phagocytosis.”</p>

<p>Dr. Alonzo Brown in <i>Physician and Surgeon</i> says
of phagocytosis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Recently a brilliant theory has been projected into the
histological world. It is the principle of phagocytosis. The
beauty of it is so great that we are attracted by it, and its
reasonings have riveted general attention. It is said that
certain cells have the power to absorb and so destroy other
cells. This is phagocytosis. It is said that ‘the cells which
are known to possess phagocytocic properties are the leucocytes,
mucous corpuscles, connective tissue cells, endothelia
of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, alveolar eypithelium of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>the lungs, and the cells of the spleen, bone, marrow and
lymphatic glands.’ (Senn). This is a very significant array of
colloid matter; and it has been repeatedly affirmed by the highest
authorities that alcohol is poisonous to the colloid element.</p>

<p>“Now, among the most important of the phagocytes just
enumerated are the leucocytes. They embrace and enfold the
pathogenic germs with which they come in contact by what is
known as an ameboid force. They enclose, disintegrate and
absorb the enemy. It is well known that the moment the leucocytes
are submitted to an alcoholic solution, their ameboid
movements cease, and their function is arrested. It is plain
that their phagocytocic power is immediately destroyed. It is
possible, also, that the fixed tissue-cells are likewise impaired
or killed by alcoholic imbibition. How deleterious, and even
deadly, must the internal administration of alcoholic liquors then
be in the treatment of diphtheria, and of other diseases having
a germinal origin? It therefore follows, to my mind, that all the
diseases which are the result of germinal infection, are most
badly treated when alcohol is used in their therapy.</p>

<p>“With extreme brevity I advert to another view in the field.
It is that of adynamic disease. It has been conclusively proven
that alcohol decreases the muscular power. It decreases (from
the minimum dose to the maximum) the power of the heart as
well as that of all other muscles. I say this has been absolutely
demonstrated by Richardson and others. In death from adynamia
it is through failure of muscle, that is, of the heart, of
the scaleni and intercostals, of the diaphragm, and of the laryngeal
muscles, et cetera. All of the muscles may gradually fail,
become wearied unto death. How pernicious then must
alcohol be in adding its influence to bring about the tragic end!</p>

<p>“It is my belief that it is in diphtheria that the most dire
results are to be observed. In that disease the vast majority
of cases die by asthenia, or else by sudden failure of the heart.
To what is this sudden cardiac paralysis due? The elucidation
is as follows. In the grave cases there is almost invariably a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>subnormal temperature, together with great muscular prostration.
Also it is a physiological fact that a decrease of the
temperature slows nervous conduction. As the system is
made colder, the nervous force flows slower and slower. In
diphtheria the heart muscle is very weak, the temperature falls,
the lessened nervous energy but feebly animates the muscular
fibres, and so actual paralysis ensues, death closing the scene
almost instantaneously. Now, in such a state of imminent
danger, brought about by such causes, what could be worse
than to administer an agent which notably reduces temperature,
and at the same time enfeebles muscular power? May
I add, what could be the remedy in such a condition? and I
answer, <i>External heat freely applied to the whole surface of
the body</i>. This will prevent the cardiac paralysis whenever it
is preventable.”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Medical Pioneer</i> of Dec., 1892, contained an
editorial article upon “The Toxine Alcohol,” which
deals with leucocytes and their functions. The
following is the article:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Dr. Broadbent’s introductory address at the opening of the
session at Owen’s College, Manchester, deserves more attention
than most of these formal deliveries. He dwelt on the intellectual
interest which attaches to the study of medical science,
and illustrated it, among other ways, by the interest excited by
recent observations on the action of bacilli and the combat
which goes on between these invading hosts and the guardian
cells or leucocytes of the living body. Inflammation surrounding
a wound is regarded as caused by the influx and multiplication
of leucocytes to engulf and destroy septic bacilli which
have gained entrance from the air, a ‘local war’ of defence.
The issue of this pitched battle will depend on the relative
number and activity of the respective hosts. Inflammation
round a poisoned wound is an evidence of vital power and a
means of protecting the system at large from invasion and dev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>astation.
If this first line of defence is broken through, the
bacilli pass through the lymphatic spaces and ducts to the
glands, and another battle ensues which produces glandular
swelling and inflammation and possibly abscess. This second
line of defence may be insufficient and then we get general
septicæmia. It is now well proven that the injury is done,
not by the bacilli themselves but by the toxines which they
secrete or excrete. Dr. Broadbent very properly points out
that the action of the bacilli of fever in the body is strictly
comparable to the action of yeast in a fermentable liquid. The
yeast cells grow and multiply at the expense of the sugar, in destroying
which they produce alcohol, carbonic dioxide and other
substances. When the alcohol amounts to some 17 per cent. of
the liquid the process is stopped by the poisonous action of the
alcohol on the yeast cells. In just the same way the toxines
produced by the bacilli at length stop their further multiplication
and put an end to the disease. Alcohol is in fact, the toxine
produced by yeast, and, like many other toxines, it is not
only poisonous to cells which produce it, but to any animal into
whose veins it may happen to get.</p>

<p>“There can be little doubt that the state of immunity which
one attack of certain fevers confers against future attacks
depends partly upon what is called the phagocytic action of
leucocytes. These have been actually observed to draw into
their interior and destroy bacilli which would otherwise have
multiplied and produced their special effects. There can be
little doubt, either, that we are continually taking into our
systems bacilli of all sorts, and that, again, disease is averted
by the activity of the germ-devouring leucocytes. Dr. Broadbent
describes an experiment which proves that power of resisting
disease is largely dependent on the activity of these
cells. A rabbit, having had a certain quantity of bacilli injected
under its skin, suffers from inflammation at the spot, and
perhaps abscess, but recovers. At the same time, another
rabbit is treated in precisely the same way, but, simultaneously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>a dose of chloral is injected into another part of the body. The
chloral, circulating in the blood, is known to paralyze leucocytes,
and, as a result of this, they do not collect and wage war
on the bacilli injected under the skin; there is very little local
reaction, the bacilli get free course into the lymph and blood,
and the animal dies. But, in the words of Dr. Broadbent,
‘alcohol in excess has a similar action on the leucocytes, and
this, as well as the deteriorating influence of chronic alcoholism
on the tissues, predisposes to septic infection. A single debauch,
therefore, may open the door to fever or erysipelas.’
A <a name="Page_275t" id="Page_275t"></a><a href="#Page_275tn">similar</a> experiment of Doyen confirms this. He found that
guinea pigs can be killed by the cholera microbe, when introduced
by the mouth, if a dose of alcohol has been previously
administered. It has been the general testimony of observers
in cholera epidemics that those addicted to much alcohol are
far more liable to fatal attacks. But while large doses of
alcohol are, of course, more obviously injurious, it would be
absurd to imagine that lesser quantities are entirely without
influence in the same direction. It has, indeed, been shown by
Dr. Ridge, that even infinitesimal quantities of alcohol, such as
one part in 5,000, cause a more rapid multiplication of the
<i>bacillus subtilis</i> and other bacilli of decomposition, while, by
the same quantities, the growth of both animal and vegetable
protoplasm is retarded. Hence there can be no longer any
question that alcohol renders the body more liable to conquest
by invading microbes, less able to resist and destroy them.
Alcohol, a toxine injurious to living cells, is destroyed or removed
from the body as fast as nature can effect it, but while
it remains, and while able to affect the cells at all, its action is
detrimental to healthy growth and healthy life, and the less we
take of such an agent the better for us. This is a dictum which
it becomes the profession to enunciate far and wide. ‘The
less, the better’ is a watchword which all may use, and the
wise will interpret it in a way which will infallibly preserve them
altogether from all possible danger from such a source.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>On the sixteenth of December, 1897, Dr. Sims
Woodhead, president of the British Medical Temperance
Association, gave a masterly address in
London upon “Recent Researches on the Action
of Alcohol.” The lecture was illustrated by
lantern slides. From the report given in <i>The Medical
Temperance Review</i> of Jan., 1898, the following is
culled:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In a series of drawings of kidney you will notice first that
there is a condition known as cloudy swelling; this is one of
the first changes that can be observed. Notice the characteristic
features of this cloudy swelling in the cells of all these
specimens. The large swollen cells are granular, and very frequently
there is a granular mass in the lumen of the tubule.
In some cases the cells are so much swollen that the lumen of
the tubule is represented merely by a ‘star-shaped’ radiating
chink. The nucleus is usually somewhat obscured, that this
alcoholic cloudy swelling (similar to that met with as the result of
the administration of certain poisons) is the first change observed
in the parenchymatous cells of the organs of animals that have
died of acute alcoholic poisoning. This condition, unless the
cause is removed, goes on to a condition of fatty-degeneration,
as shown in the next specimen in which we have, in addition
to the granular appearance of the protoplasm of the cell, a deposition
of masses of fat in and at the expense of this protoplasm.</p>

<p>“There is another series of changes to which I wish to draw
your attention. In the tubules of the kidney we have, in addition
to the granular appearance of the protoplasm of the cells,
an increase in the number of leucocytes, and connective tissue
cells between the tubules around the glomeruli and along the
course of the blood-vessels. This condition of small cell infiltration,
we know, is constantly associated with inflammatory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>conditions of the kidney as in other organs. Here then are the
changes in the epithelium plus increase in the number of leucocytes.</p>

<p>“I show you too a specimen of heart muscle, in which the
granular degeneration, or cloudy swelling is well marked
whilst here and there the process is going on to fatty degeneration,
similar to that seen in the kidney. Here again, then, the
active elements of the organ are becoming broken down, or, at
any rate, losing their normal structure and affording evidence
of fundamental changes in these cells. Such changes are set
up, not by any one poison alone, or by any single disease
toxin, but by members of many groups of poisons, by alcohols,
ethers, etc. indeed by very various poisons&mdash;animal, vegetable
and mineral.</p>

<p>“Now, it is a peculiar fact, as shown by Massart, Bordet and
others, in researches on chemiotaxis, that nearly all these
poisons have the power of repelling leucocytes, and of seriously
interfering with them in the performance of their functions, and
this power assumes a special significance in connection with
our subject this afternoon.</p>

<p>“Now, two of the great functions of leucocytes under ordinary
conditions are those of policing and scavenging. Massart
and Bordet showed, under the action of certain substances,
alcohol amongst others, these functions are lost, but following
up Metchnikoff and others they observed that after a time these
same leucocytes became accustomed to the presence of these
poisons, gradually becoming ‘acclimatized’ as it were. At
first paralyzed or repelled, they after a time pluck up courage to
attack the invading substances and carry on or renew their
accustomed work of scavenging; they try to get rid of both
poisons and poison-producers, and even acquire the power of
forming substances (anti-toxins) which can neutralize the poison
and allow the cells to devote their energy to doing their own
proper work.</p>

<p>“Here are drawings of minute abscesses that have formed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>in the wall of the heart. We see at once the part that the leucocytes
play in attacking micro-organisms, and of localizing their
action. Look at the blood-vessel in the wall of the heart with
its plug of micro-organism (staphylococci) in the centre of a clear
space; here the leucocytes are not numerous, indeed they are
very sparsely scattered, and appear to have been driven back
by the organisms or their toxics. Then a little distance away
from the toxin and toxin-forming organisms, the leucocytes are
coming up in large numbers, forming a sort of protecting army,
as it were. This is known as leucocytosis. In the small
patent vessels around this commencing abscess numerous
leucocytes, far in excess of the usual proportion, may be seen&mdash;the
nearer the abscess, the more numerous they become.
Thus the leucocytes make their way to what is to become the
wall of the abscess, and form a layer around a mass of micro-organisms,
localizing, or attempting to localize, such mass.
So long as the leucocytes can make their way to this mass,
and shut it off from the surrounding tissue, so long we shall
have no extension of the abscess.</p>

<p>“Now, if you add something&mdash;alcohol in the case we are
considering&mdash;which not only exerts a negative chemiotaxic
action&mdash;i. e., which drives the leucocyte away&mdash;but which, as
we have seen, also causes degeneration of nerve, muscle and
epithelial cells, shall we not injure the infected patient both
directly and indirectly by interfering with the return of the
leucocytes driven away, by diminishing or altering the functional
activity of these cells, and indirectly by interfering with
the excretion of the poisons (owing, as we have seen, to a
degenerated condition of the secretory epithelium)? Have we
not, in fact, a cumulative action of two substances, either of
which alone would do damage, but not in the same proportion
as do the two when acting together.</p>

<p>“Now let us see what we may learn from a series of experiments
carried out by Dr. Abbott, working in the Laboratory of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>Hygiene of the University of Pennsylvania, under the auspices
of the committee of fifty, to investigate the Alcohol Question.</p>

<p>“These are his conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. “That the normal vital resistance of rabbits to infection by
streptococcus pyogenes is markedly diminished through the
influence of alcohol when given daily to the stage of acute
intoxication. 2. That a similar, though by no means so conspicuous,
diminution of resistance to infection and intoxication
by the bacillus coli communis also occurs in rabbits subjected
to the same influences.</p>

<p>“Throughout these experiments, with few exceptions, it will
be seen that the alcoholized animals not only showed the
effects of the inoculations earlier than did the non-alcoholized
rabbits, but in the case of the streptococcus inoculations, the
lesions produced (formation of miliary abscesses) were much
more pronounced than are those that usually follow inoculations
with this organism.</p>

<p>“With regard to the predisposing influence of the alcohol,
one is constrained to believe that it is in most cases the result
of structural alterations consequent upon its direct action on
the tissues, though in a number of animals no such alterations
could be made out by microscopic examinations. I am inclined,
however, to the belief, in the light of the work of
Berkley and Friedenwald, done under the direction of Professor
Welch, in the pathological laboratory of the Johns
Hopkins University, that a closer study of the tissues of these
animals would have revealed in all of them structural changes
of such a nature as to indicate disturbances of important vital
functions of sufficient gravity fully to account for the loss of
normal resistance.</p>

<p>“Following up Dr. Abbott’s experiments, Dr. Deléarde,
working in Calmette’s laboratory in the <i>Institut Pasteur</i> at
Lille, made a series of observations which are, from many
points of view, of very great interest and importance as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>attacks it from an entirely new standpoint, one that will, I
hope, ere long, be taken up by those working in this country.
It has already been demonstrated that ‘alcoholics’ suffer far
more seriously from microbic affections than do those of sober
life, and it is now accepted that amongst them the mortality
from this class of disease is higher than amongst those who
are not accustomed to take alcohol regularly or to excess.</p>

<p>“It is pointed out, as most of us have from time to time had
the opportunity of observing, that, taking pneumonia as an
example of this class of disease, there can be no doubt that the
alcoholic patient has not merely an appreciably smaller chance
for recovery, but an apparently slight attack becomes one in
which the chances of recovery come to be against the patient
rather than in his favor. I well remember when I was House
Physician in the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh that Dr. Muirhead,
who almost invariably treated his pneumonic patients
without alcohol, used to say that an ordinary case of acute
pneumonia should always recover under careful treatment, but
that cases of pneumonia in ‘alcoholics’ were always most
anxious cases and in every way unsatisfactory. (Slides were
shown on screen to illustrate the changes taking place in pneumonia,
the conditions of leucocytosis, and the very important
part which leucocytes play in the process of ‘clearing up’ during
the course of the patient’s recovery). Dr. Deléarde in an
admirable summary gives the principal features of pneumonia
in alcoholics. He describes it as running a comparatively
prolonged course, as being often accompanied by a violent
delirium, following which is a period of prostration or of coma;
even in those who recover, abscesses frequently occur in the
liver, or in other organs. He also points out that there may be
a similar chain of events in other infective conditions such as
erysipelas and typhoid fever, but as he insists that, until Abbott’s
experiments on the streptococcus,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> staphylococcus<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and bacterium
coli,<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in alcoholized and non-alcoholized animals, little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>attempt has been made to indicate the mechanism, or, at any
rate, the process by which alcoholized individuals are rendered
more susceptible to the invasion and action of micro-organisms.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Microbes or bacteria of different kinds.</p></div>

<p>“As we have already seen, Abbott’s experiments prove beyond
doubt that attenuated disease-producing organisms, which in
healthy animals do not kill immediately, bring about a fatal
result when the animal has previously been treated with alcohol.
In order to determine which was the most important
factor in the destruction or weakening of the resisting agents
in the body, Dr. Deléarde conceived the idea of experimenting
with those diseases in which it has been found possible to produce,
artificially, as it were, and under controlled conditions, an
immunity or insusceptibility in healthy animals. He carried
out a series of experiments on rabbits, immunizing against and
infecting with the virus of hydrophobia, tetanus and anthrax.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
To these rabbits he first administered a quantity of alcohol,
from 6 to 8 c.c. at first, and gradually rises to 10 c.c. doses
per diem.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Carbuncle.</p></div>

<p>“There is in the first instance a slight falling off in weight of
the animal, but after a time this ceases, and the animal may
again become heavier, until the original weight is reached. He
then took a series of animals and vaccinated them against
hydrophobia. In one set the animals were afterwards alcoholized
and then injected with a considerable quantity of virulent
rabic cord. It was here found that immunity against
rabies had not been lost.</p>

<p>“In a second set the vaccination and alcoholization were carried
on simultaneously, a fatal dose (as proved by control experiment)
of rabic cord was then injected, when it was found
that little or no immunity had been acquired. In a third series
the alcohol was stopped before the immunizing process was
commenced. In this case marked immunity was acquired.</p>

<p>“As regards rabies, then, acute alcoholism, especially when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>continued for comparatively short periods, simply has the effect
of preventing the acquisition of immunity when alcohol is administered
during the period when the immunizing process
ought to be going on. This indicates that the action of the
alcohol in acute alcoholism is direct, and that although its
administration prevents the acquisition of immunity it does not
alter the cells so materially that they cannot regain some of
their original powers, whilst once the immunity has been gained
by the cells, alcohol cannot, immediately, so fundamentally
alter them that they lose the immunity they have already
acquired. When we come to the consideration of the case of
tetanus, however, we are carried a step further. Dr. Deléarde
repeating his immunizing and alcoholizing experiments, but
now working with tetanus virus in place of rabic virus, found&mdash;and,
perhaps, here it may be as well to give his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) “‘That animals vaccinated against tetanus and afterwards
alcoholized lose their immunity against tetanus;</p>

<p>(2) “‘That animals vaccinated against tetanus and at the same
time alcoholized do not readily acquire immunity;</p>

<p>(3) “‘That animals first alcoholized and then vaccinated may
acquire immunity against tetanus if alcohol is suppressed from
the commencement of the process of vaccination.’</p>

<p>“In the case of anthrax too, as we gather from another
series of experiments, it is almost impossible to confer immunity,
if the animal is alcoholized during the time that it is being
vaccinated, and although the animals, first alcoholized and then
vaccinated, may acquire a certain amount of immunity, they
rapidly lose condition and are certainly more ill than non-alcoholized
animals vaccinated simultaneously.</p>

<p>“We have already mentioned that Massart and Bordet some
years ago pointed out that alcohol, even in very dilute solutions,
exerts a very active negative chemiotaxis, i. e., it appears to
have properties by which leucocytes are repelled or driven
away from its neighborhood and actions. Alcohol thus pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>vents
the cells from attacking invading bodies or of reacting in
the presence of the toxins which also, as is well known, exert a
more or less marked negative chemiotaxis, i.e., the cells appear
to be paralyzed. In all diseases, then, in which the leucocytes
help to remove an invading organism or in which they have the
power of reacting or of carrying on their functions in the presence
of a toxin, we should expect that alcohol would to a certain
extent deprive them of this power or interfere with their
capacity for acquiring a greater resisting power or of reinforcing
the powers of resistance. It appears indeed to reinforce
the poison formed by pathogenic organisms. Dr. Deléarde
maintains moreover that chronic alcoholism increases enormously
the difficulty of rendering an animal immune to anthrax,
whilst as those who have had any experience of cases of
anthrax know full well alcoholics, whether acute or chronic,
manifest a remarkable susceptibility both as regards attacks of
anthrax and the fatality of the disease when once contracted.
Further as clinical proof of the correctness of another of these
sets of experiments, Dr. Deléarde instances two cases of rabies
which have come under observation in the Institut Pasteur&mdash;one,
a man of 30 years of age, of intemperate habits who after
a complete treatment of 18 days after a bite in the hand died of
hydrophobia; the other, a child of 13 years who was bitten on the
face by the same dog that had attacked the other patient, and
on the same day&mdash;who underwent the same treatment remained
perfectly well. In this case the more severe bite (the
face being the most serious position in which a person can be
bitten) was received by the child; indeed the intemperate habits
of the man, who even took alcohol during treatment, appear to
have been the only more serious factor in his case as compared
with that of the child.</p>

<p>“From all this Dr. Deléarde draws the practical conclusion
that patients who have been bitten by a mad dog should as far
as possible abstain from the use of alcohol not only during the
process of treatment, but also for some time afterwards, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>for a period of eight months, during which period, apparently,
increase of immunity may be going on. Beyond this he maintains
that doctors often commit a grave error in administering
strong doses of alcohol to patients suffering from certain infectious
diseases such as pneumonia, or from certain intoxications
such as those produced by snake-bite, during which an increase
in the number of leucocytes appear to be a necessary part of
any process that leads to the cure of the patient. Finally, he
points out how necessary it is that we should respect the integrity
of the leucocytes in the presence of microbic infections or
intoxications. We may accept these statements all the more
readily as Dr. Deléarde states that ‘although we must recognize
that small doses of dilute alcoholic beverages are indicated in
certain cases where it is necessary to stimulate the nervous
system, one must guard oneself against an abuse which may
certainly be prejudicial to the putting into operation of the
mechanism of defence against the organisms of disease.’</p>

<p>“In so far as these conclusions rest on a series of exact experiments
we are justified in accepting them as being a most
valuable contribution to the question; where there is no experimental
basis, we must exercise our own judgment. To show
the very strong impression that exists that there is some connection
between severe cases of pneumonia and alcohol I may
mention that the other day I heard a gentleman (not a medical
man) say, ‘It is well known that most men (of a certain profession)
die from alcoholism.’ When asked to explain he said,
‘They all die from cirrhosis or pneumonia, and if those conditions
are not due to alcoholism, what is?’</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt that in addition to its specific action,
alcohol has a general action&mdash;the mal-nutrition, which is usually
associated with the use of alcohol, especially as a result of its
action on the mucous membranes of the stomach, etc.”</p></div>

<p>That the “guardian cells” of the body play a part
in a considerable number of diseases was illustrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>by Dr. Woodhead by drawings and photographs,
shown on the lantern screen. The photographs included
cells containing anthrax, typhoid and tubercle
bacilli, the spirilla of relapsing fever, specimens
from cases of anthrax. Specimens were shown in
which the cells were actually ingesting and digesting
the specific micro-organisms. In a case of typhoid,
showing large masses of typhoid bacilli in
one of Peyer’s patches, there were seen certain of
the cells which contained the typhoid bacilli, some
of them undergoing degenerative changes, and
showing unequal standing.</p>

<p>Of the researches made by Dr. Abbott referred
to in the foregoing lecture Dr. N. S. Davis says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Thus we have another and direct positive demonstration of
the fact that the presence of alcohol in living bodies not only
impairs all the physiological processes, but also impairs their
vital resistance to the effects of all other poisons. It was
hardly necessary, however, to trouble the rabbits to obtain
proof of this; for such evidence may be found in abundance
by examining the vital statistics of every civilized country. The
late Frank H. Hamilton, in his valuable work on military
hygiene, gives an interesting account of an experiment executed,
not on a few rabbits, but on whole regiments of human beings,
who were being exposed to the inhibition, not of the streptococcus
pyogenes, but to the infections of malarial and typho-malaria
fever. And, as many were attacked with sickness, it
was thought by some of those in authority that if the soldiers
were given a specified ration of alcoholic liquor two or three
times a day, it might enable them to resist the morbid influences
to which they were exposed. The proposed ration was
accordingly ordered, and Dr. Hamilton informs us that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>soldiers taking the liquor ration succumbed to the morbific
influences surrounding them so much more rapidly than before,
that in less than sixty days the order was countermanded, and
the liquor ration stopped. And that eminent surgeon and
sanitarian added, with peculiar emphasis, that he wished never
to see the same experiment tried again.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge, of London, has learned through
his experiments that alcohol not only hinders the
leucocytes in their war upon disease germs, but also
tends to the multiplication of germs. Of this he
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The antagonism of alcohol to the fundamental functions of
life is further exhibited by its action on the cellular elements of
living tissues and the free cells or leucocytes of the blood. Dr.
Lionel Beale long ago pointed out how it affected the protoplasm
of cells, and diminished the movements of amœbae, to
which leucocytes are apparently analogous.</p>

<p>“But while alcohol is thus injurious to living protoplasm, or
<i>constructive protoplasm</i> as it may be called, that which builds
up, and forms all kinds of structures, and living beings of all
higher types, I accidentally discovered that in minute quantities,
under about one per cent., and even in such almost incredible
amounts as 1 part in 100,000, (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> millilitre in 10 litres) it favors
the growth and multiplication of many microbes whose function
is antagonistic to the protoplasm of organized beings, and
which may therefore be called <i>destructive protoplasm</i>. We
know that these microbes are kept at bay by the vitality of the
tissues; if this vitality is lowered they may prevail: as soon as
life departs they set to work, and decomposition is the result.
It is, therefore, not very surprising that an agent, like alcohol,
which, we have seen, lowers the vitality of constructive protoplasm,
should, on the other hand increase the vitality of destructive
protoplasm. At any rate such is the fact. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>presence of these minute quantities of alcohol, decomposition
goes on more rapidly, and the micrococci and bacilli, thrive and
swarm more abundantly. This is easily demonstrable by the
more rapid, and thicker, cloudiness of any clear decomposable
liquor in the course of a day or two, or in a few days, according
to circumstances. But I have demonstrated the more rapid
multiplication of some forms by means of plate cultivations, of
which I show specimens. It is true of the bacteria of decomposition,
of the streptococci, and staphylococci of pus, and of
diphtheria. Time alone has been wanting to demonstrate this
in other cases, which I hope to do.”</p></div>

<p>The <i>Medical Week</i> some time ago contained this
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Dr. Viala, in collaboration with Dr. Charrin, says: ‘I have
carried out a series of researches on the toxicity of various alcoholic
beverages in common use, such as wines and brandies
of all brands, from those which are reputed the best to those of
very inferior quality. All these products have been analyzed
with the greatest care. Our experiments were carried out on
fifty animals. Intravenous injections confirm Dr. Daremberg’s
statement that liquors considered as the best are the most toxic,
more particularly as regards their immediate effects.’”</p></div>

<p>Although the foregoing statement directs the
reader’s attention to the comparative effects of different
alcoholic liquors, it also plainly implies several
facts of great importance. The first is, that all
alcoholic liquors, fermented or distilled, are toxic
or poisonous; and the more pure alcohol they contain,
the more poisonous are they, the qualities of
liquor differing only in the rapidity of their injurious
effects.</p>

<p>In the same number of the <i>Medical Week</i>, Pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>fessor
Gréhant states that after injecting a quantity
of alcohol into the venous circulation of a dog equal
to one twenty-fifth, or four per cent., of the estimated
weight of the blood of the animal, he found
by several analyses at different times that it required
“a little over twenty-three hours for complete
elimination of the alcohol from the blood.”
If we consider these results obtained by Viala,
Charrin, Daremberg and Gréhant, with those obtained
by Dr. A. C. Abbott, showing the direct effect
of alcohol in diminishing the normal vital
resistance of the living body to infection, we see
excellent reasons why the liberal use of alcohol in
the treatment of such infectious diseases as diphtheria,
typhoid fever and pneumonia, under the supposition
that it was a cardiac tonic, has resulted in
so great a mortality as from thirty to sixty per cent.</p>

<p>Dr. A. Pearce Gould, a London hospital surgeon
of the first rank, has made special study of the
surgery of the blood-vessels, and of the chest. He
was one of the earliest to practice and advocate the
careful removal of the axillary glands in all operations
for cancer of the breast.</p>

<p>He is a strong believer in the value of total
abstinence as promoting robust health of body and
mind. He regards the value of alcohol in disease
as exceedingly small, and prescribes it only very
rarely. He thinks that alcohol increases the
activity of cancer and other malignant growths, an
opinion which is of great importance from one with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>such exceptional opportunities for observation in
these complaints.</p>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis in the <i>American Medical Temperance
Quarterly</i> of January, 1895, gives reports of
cases which came under his observation as a consulting
physician, where the use of alcoholics
throughout an extended illness favored the continuance
of delirium, or mild mental disorder, after
convalescence was established. In each case the
withdrawal of the alcohol was followed by a cessation
of the mental delusion.</p>

<p>One of these cases may be taken as an example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The third case was that of a woman over sixty years of age,
who had suffered from a mild grade of fever and protracted
diarrhœa, somewhat resembling a mild grade of enteric typhoid
fever.</p>

<p>“As she became much reduced in strength during the latter
part of her diarrhœa, her friends began to give her wine, and
sometimes stronger alcoholic drink, under the popular delusion
that these could strengthen her. Her mind soon became wandering,
and she was troubled with illusions, which were attributed
to her weakness, and the so-called stimulants were
increased. But the mental disorder increased also, and continued
after the fever and diarrhœa had ceased, until the question
was raised concerning the propriety of her removal to an
asylum for the insane.</p>

<p>“Being consulted at that time, and listening to an accurate history
of the case, I suggested that the anæsthetic effect of the alcohol
on the cerebral hemispheres, in connection with its effect on
the hemoglobin, and other elements of the blood, in lessening
the reception and internal distribution of oxygen, might be
the cause of both the perpetuation of her weakness, and her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>mental disorder. I advised a trial of its entire omission, and
the giving of only simple nourishment, and moderate doses of
strychnine and digitalis, as nerve tonics. My advice was followed,
though not without much hesitation on the part of her
friends. The result, however, was entire recovery from the
mental disorder, and some improvement in her general health.”</p></div>

<p>Puerperal mania resulted in one case cited, from
the use of a moderate amount of wine at mealtimes;
when the wine was abandoned the mania subsided.</p>

<h3>WHY DOCTORS STILL PRESCRIBE ALCOHOLICS.</h3>


<p>Workers in the department of Medical Temperance
of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union
are told repeatedly by the better class of physicians
that they would be glad often not to prescribe alcohol
if patients and their friends would not insist upon its
use. There is a deep-rooted prejudice in favor of
alcohol as a remedy in the minds of the great multitude
of people, and they are ready to distrust as fanatical,
or incompetent, any physician who does not use it.
Dr. Norman Kerr, a well-known physician of England,
says, that during a ten years’ residence in America, he
found people unwilling to pay him as much for his
services as they were willing to pay one who prescribed
alcoholics. Even those who were abstainers from
liquors as beverages distrusted him for not using
these things as medicines. Indeed, this prejudice
goes so far with many that they will refuse to
employ a non-alcoholic physician, if they know him
to be such. In consequence of this latter fact,
there are great numbers of skilful physicians who
say nothing about alcohol lest they be con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>sidered
“faddists,” and lose practice, but who
never prescribe it unless it is asked for by the
patient or his friends.</p>

<p>Again, consulting physicians will sometimes insist
upon the use of alcohol, and thus seeds of distrust
of the non-alcoholic physician will be sown.</p>

<p>Dr. J. J. Ridge says of medical prescriptions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Hundreds of medical men order alcoholic liquors from
habit, from ignorance of their real effect, from fashion, or
from a desire to please, or not to offend, their patients. Port-wine
is constantly being ordered when persons are recovering
from various diseases; day by day they regain their strength,
and the port-wine gets all the credit of it, especially since
each glass seems to diffuse a comfortable glow over the whole
body. They forget that the process of recovery would have
gone on without the port, and that hundreds and thousands of
people do get well without it. They often ignore the fact that
they are taking real tonics in addition. They are misled by
the sensations which the alcohol causes; they do not know
that it relaxes the blood-vessels instead of improving their tone;
that it exhausts the heart by making it beat away more rapidly
to no profit. Hence the convalescence is actually more
prolonged than it would otherwise be. Gentle exercise, regulated
baths, good food, balmy sleep, these are the true restoratives
of the exhausted system, and no jugglery with sedatives,
such as alcohol, can produce the desired result.</p>

<p>“It is by its sedative action that alcohol has obtained its position
in public opinion. It will render persons insensible to
various uneasy sensations, and the majority prefer to continue
the bad habits which produce the uneasy sensations, and then
to take them away by a dose or two of some alcoholic liquor,
or, indeed, to take this before the uneasy sensations come on.
In this way they do themselves injury and make themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>unconscious of it. Dr. Beaumont, who had the opportunity of
examining the interior of Alexis St. Martin’s stomach, and of
seeing how digestion went on, was astonished to see how
inflamed the mucous membrane could be without any consciousness
of it. He observed, as a matter of fact, that alcoholic
drinks of all kinds hindered the process of digestion, and
produced this morbid condition of the mucous membrane.
The relief, therefore, which can be obtained by alcohol is
delusive and dangerous.</p>

<p>“But some persons say they are afraid to abandon the use of
alcohol because they have been in the habit of taking it for a
long period. This fear is entirely groundless. The alcohol
will be missed for a time, just as a person who has been using
crutches would miss them if thrown away; but they will do
better without both after a little while. There is no kind of
constitution which renders a person unable to do without alcohol.
The prisoners in all our jails have to leave off their drink
at once, and altogether, on entering there, and no harm ever
ensues in consequence. But some say that this is because their
diet is so carefully arranged, and the hygienic condition of the
prison so perfect. Quite so. This shows us clearly that when
total abstainers become ill outside the prison, their illness is to
be attributed to some error in diet or hygiene, or to some
accidental circumstance. It is absurd to think that the infraction
of one law of health can be nullified by breaking another;
that if you eat too much, or too fast, or too often, or what is
not good for you, you can escape the consequences by injuring
yourself with alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. N. S. Davis was for many years openly
sneered at by many of his professional brethren as
“a cold-water fanatic.” Since his views are now
being rapidly adopted by progressive medical men
all over the civilized world, it may be that soon those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>physicians who cling to alcohol will deserve the
soubriquet of “alcohol fanatics.” Dr. Davis said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If I am asked why the profession continues to prescribe
these drinks, I answer; simply from the force of habit and traditional
education, coupled with a reluctance to risk the experiment
of omitting them while the general popular notions
sanction their use. Nothing is easier than self-deception in
this matter. A patient is suddenly taken with syncope, or
nervous weakness, from which abundant experience has shown
that a speedy recovery would take place by simple rest and
fresh air. But in the alarm of friends something must be done.
A little wine or brandy is given, and as it is not sufficient to
positively prevent, the patient in due time revives just as would
have been the case if neither wine nor brandy had been used.</p>

<p>“Of course both doctor and friends will regard the so-called
stimulant as the cause of the recovery. So, too, when patients
are getting weak, in the advanced stage of fever, or some other
self-limited disease, an abundance of nourishment is regularly
administered, in the greater part of which is mixed some kind
of alcoholic drink. The latter will always occupy the chief attention,
and if, after a severe run, the fever, or disease, finally
disappears, it will be said that the patient was sustained or
‘kept alive’ for over two or three weeks, as the case may be,
‘solely by the stimulants,’ when, in fact, if the same nourishment
and care had been given without a drop of alcohol, he
would have convalesced sooner, and more perfectly, as I have
seen demonstrated a thousand times in my experience.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Casgrau, of Dublin, says that physicians who
make personal use of alcohol are not able to give
an unbiased opinion about its action, as one of its
most marked effects is that of a narcotic to the mental
powers; such physicians are not so acute to observe
the action of this, or any drug.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir B. W. Richardson, M. D., in an address upon
the reasons why physicians still prescribe alcoholics,
says that the magnetism of public opinion has
great weight with professional men.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“All professions are under that subtle influence. All professions
whatever their duties, whatever their learning may be,
are sensitive and obedient to that influence. In their pride
they think they lead public opinion; it is a mistake, they always
follow it on every question in which the people, at large, have a
voice. They can assist in influencing the public voice, and
sometimes, to quote the words of Abbé Purcelle, spoken in the
dawn of the great French Revolution, they may prove that
‘respect for sovereign power sometimes consists in transgressing
its orders,’ but as a general rule not merely the orders but
the inclinations are obeyed. We have to wait on, and for, public
opinion, and in nothing so much as on the subject of alcohol.
The use of alcoholic beverages rests not on argument but
on habit, custom. To those whom it affects personally it is an
absolute monarch. It makes its own empire. By the very
action which it has upon the body of those who receive it into
themselves it rules and governs. The joke of the inebriate
man that when he had taken his potation he was quite another
man and that then he felt it his duty to treat that other man,
is literally true, a terse and faithful expression of a natural fact.
The man or woman born and bred under the influence of alcohol
is of the race of alcohol, and as distinct a person as any
racial peculiarity can supply. The reason, the judgment, the
temper, the senses are attuned by it. It is loved by its lovers
like life. The grape to them is no longer a luscious fruit; it is
‘the mother of mighty wine,’ and he who is bold enough to disown
that motherhood must stand apart. How can a profession
however strong, march all at once against such an overwhelming
influence? Itself born, perchance, under the influence
bred under it, how shall it immediately be transformed? Why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>disobey the influence? It is in the <i>interest</i> of the doctor to
obey, in a worldly sense of view; but more&mdash;it is in his <i>nature</i>
to obey. The strong bands of nature and interest go hand in
hand. Is it wonderful that the genius of a professional man
so situated should, according to the quality of his genius, uphold,
root and branch, the rôle of his nativity? On the contrary
the wonder is that he has ever done anything else. It is
most natural that he should be amongst the last to take up
what revolutionizes all the manners, and customs, and faiths, of
society. A lady will ask her physician the question, May I
take wine, Sir? As much as you like Madam; it is very bad
for you and I take none, but that is your business entirely.
Henceforth that gentleman is said to be one who prescribes alcohol
in any quantity. In fact, he never prescribes it, for although
when forbidding is hopeless, there is all the difference
in the world between prescribing and permitting, permitting
goes down as if it were prescribing. Often a patient will try
to compromise. On an ocean of whisky and water, brandy and
soda, or other poisonous mixture, he is floating into fatal paralysis.
You tell him so faithfully, and he says he knows it and
will drop down to claret. If you assent, he tells his friends you
have changed his brandy or whisky to wine; if you dissent, he
says you have left your duty as a doctor undone, in order to become
an advocate for abstaining temperance, about which he is
as competent a judge as you are, and he won’t pay fees for that
advice. He pays to be cured of his disease, not to be dragooned
into a system peculiar in its tenets. In an alcoholic world
there is a strong argument in this decision. It rolls splendidly,
especially down hill.”</p></div>

<p>After speaking of non-alcoholic physicians, and
their opinions of the harmfulness of alcohol, he
adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“On the other side, there are practitioners who, under the
magnetism of public opinion, as earnestly believe the opposite
in relation to alcohol, who declare they could not, conscienti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>ously,
practice their profession if they were debarred the use of
alcohol, and who look on the advance and the growth of scientific
abstaining principles&mdash;which they cannot avoid recognizing&mdash;with
positive dread. The extremists on this side are indeed
extreme in their fanaticism. They shut their eyes to the most
obvious facts, and do not hesitate in their blindness to misrepresent
the most obvious truths. They affirm that under the influence
of total abstinence and, by inference, because of total
abstinence, the yearly decreasing death-rate of the population
is accompanied by reduction of vitality; that people who live
long are more enfeebled than those who live short lives and
merry; that under abstinence from alcohol fearful diseases are
being developed; that the total abstainers have less power for
resisting disease than the moderate temperate; and that under
the current system of advance towards total abstinence, a very
small advance yet by the way, diseases of a low type have developed
and extended their ravages.”</p></div>

<p>It is only physicians of large conscientiousness,
or of great independence of character, who will dare
to go counter to the prejudices of the people.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is necessary to educate <i>the people</i>
in the teachings of those physicians, whose eminence
in the profession has permitted them, or
whose conscientiousness has driven them, to expose
the delusions concerning the medical value of alcoholic
beverages. When the people cease to believe
in alcoholic remedies, physicians will no longer prescribe
them. But while the majority desire the
“physicians’ prescription” as a cover for indulgence,
there will be found physicians willing to give such
prescriptions.</p>

<p>That the prescription of alcohol by physicians is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>largely a matter of routine may be seen from the
following two cases, reported to the writer by
county superintendents of the department of Medical
Temperance.</p>

<p>In the first case, the physician said to the nurse,
“If the patient’s heart becomes weak, you might
give a little brandy or whisky.” Seeing reluctance
expressed upon the nurse’s countenance, he added
hastily, “Or coffee, strong coffee will do just as
well.” The nurse in reporting this to the writer,
said, “Why couldn’t he have ordered coffee in the
first place if he thought it equally good?”</p>

<p>The second case was that of an aged woman
whose physician ordered whisky as a tonic. Her
granddaughter ventured to ask, “Would not whisky
have a narcotic rather than a tonic effect?” He
replied thoughtfully, “Well, tell the truth, I suppose
it would.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>ALCOHOLIC PROPRIETARY OR ‘PATENT’ MEDICINES.</h3>


<p>America has been called the Paradise of Quacks,
and with good reason. For years patent medicine
manufacturers had such complete control of the
American press, both secular and religious, that it
was almost impossible to reach the public with information
as to the real nature of these concoctions.
Consequently the people accepted with amazing credulity
the startling claims to miraculous cures of various
pills and potions as set forth under glaring headlines
in the daily papers. The publicity of the last few
years has hurt the traffic seriously, but it still has a
great hold upon the ignorant and credulous part of
the population, and there is still a very large number
of these preparations upon the market. Many persons
think that the Pure Food Law guarantees every drug
preparation now sold to be perfectly safe for use.
This is a great error. The guarantee means simply
that the manufacturer guarantees that his preparation
is as he states upon the label; the government guarantees
nothing concerning the matter. That the guarantee
of the manufacturer is not always truthful has
been shown by analyses of some preparations made by
state and national chemists. All the advantage that
the public has through the Pure Food Law, so far as
drug preparations are concerned, is that the percentage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>of alcohol must be printed upon the label, and the
presence of certain dangerous drugs, such as morphine,
cocaine, and acetanilid must be indicated. Thus persons
intelligent as to the nature of these drugs will
avoid medicines which the label says contains them.
The ignorant are not protected. It was difficult to
secure even this small restriction upon the sale of proprietary
medicines because of the opposition of a large
number of newspaper publishers who were sharing
the ill-gotten gains of the medical fakirs.</p>

<p>A careful compilation of manufacturers’ announcements
list 1,806 so-called patent medicines sold in
open markets, in which alcohol, opium or other
toxic drugs form constituent parts. 675 of the
preparations are known as “bitters,” stomachics, or
cordials, and alcohol enters into their composition in
quantities varying from fifteen to fifty per cent.;
390 are recommended for coughs and colds, nearly
all of which contain opium. Sixty remedies are sold
for the relief of pain, and no other purpose. 120 are
for nervous troubles, and of this number, sixty-five
have entering into their composition coca leaves, or
kola nut, or both, or are represented by their respective
active principles, cocaine or caffeine. 129 are
offered for headaches, and kindred ailments, and
usually with a guarantee to give immediate relief.
In these are generally compounded phenacetine,
caffeine, antipyrine, acetanilid, or morphine, diluted
with soda, or sugar of milk. Dysentery, diarrhœa,
cholera morbus, cramp in bowels, etc., have 185
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>quick reliefs or “cures” to their credit, nearly all of
which contain opium, many of them in addition,
alcohol, ginger, capsicum or myrrh in various combinations,
and there are numerous cases on record
where children and adults have been narcotized by
their excessive use. Some manufacturers print on
the labels covering these goods, words of caution
limiting the amount to be taken. Forty-eight compounds
for asthma contain caffeine and morphine.
Sufferers from toothache have their choice from
thirty-eight remedies, and thirty-six soothing, or
teething, syrups are provided for infants.</p>

<p>Many people have ignorantly and innocently formed
an alcohol, morphine, or cocaine habit through the use
of patent medicines. Many deaths have occurred
from headache powders of which acetanilid is the chief
ingredient. Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, chief of the Bureau
of Chemistry, says of these headache powders:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A woman has a headache and she uses one of these remedies.
It relieves the pain. When she has another attack she
uses it again and again with the same result. After a while
she finds the usual amount of the remedy does not cure the
pain. She uses two portions, and so the habit is formed
until absolute danger is confronted. For one thing must not
be forgotten: these remedies are powerful, for if they were
not they would be of no effect. They are in certain doses
deadly; they depress the nervous system; they disturb the
digestion; they interfere with natural sleep; they require to
be used in increasingly larger quantities as the system becomes
accustomed to their use; they are almost without exception
excreted by the kidneys, thus adding an additional
burden to organs already badly overworked. They produce
a habit of gaining relief which becomes an obsession and incapable
of being <a name="Page_301t" id="Page_301t"></a><a href="#Page_301tn">resisted.”</a></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be asked, “How is it if these mixtures are
harmful only, that so many people profess to have
received benefit from <a name="Page_302t" id="Page_302t"></a><a href="#Page_302tn">them?”</a> There are different
reasons for this.</p>

<p>1. The nature of such drugs as alcohol, opium and
cocaine is to benumb sensation, so that pain is
stilled, and the pain, or functional disturbance forgotten
for the time, because the nerves are drugged
into insensibility. The person <i>feels</i> better while
under the influence of the drug, so thinks it is benefiting
him.</p>

<p>2. There are people who imagine they have diseases
which they do not have; since trained physicians
occasionally err in diagnosis, it is not strange
if the laity should do likewise. Such persons are
always ready to aver that a certain medicine “cured”
them.</p>

<p>A ludicrous example of this is a woman out West,
whose picture graces the advertisements of a certain
nostrum, accompanied by a testimonial that said
nostrum cured her of a “polypus”! Upon being
written to as to how such a preparation could effect
such a cure, she answered that, after giving the testimonial,
she found that she had not had a polypus!</p>

<p>3. Some of the cures attributed to drugs, are
doubtless due to Nature. It is estimated that from
30 to 90 per cent. of ailments are cured by Nature,
unassisted, and often in spite of, the drugs swallowed.
Many of the books advertising these remedies (?)
give excellent rules of health, which, if followed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>would restore persons to vigor more speedily without
the accompanying medicine, than they can be
restored while the system has the poisonous drugs
to throw off. It may be reasonably assumed that a
goodly number of recoveries ascribed to drug treatments
are due, in reality, to the resisting force of a
good constitution, or to obedience to the laws of
health given in the circular.</p>

<p>4. It is not uncommon for people suffering from
certain diseases to have temporary remissions in the
course of the disease. No doubt, some of the cases
reported as cures are such spontaneous remissions,
which are followed, after the testimonials have been
written, by relapse. The majority of people are
ignorant of the natural course of diseases&mdash;of what
happens when no treatment is taken. They do not
know that a great many affections are characterized
by periods of apparent recovery. For instance in
some varieties of paralysis, as well as in consumption,
the sufferer may to appearance recover completely
for a few months or longer; if a remedy was being
used at the time, it would naturally get the credit
of causing the favorable change.</p>

<p>However, all of the glowing testimonials of wonderful
benefits accruing from patent medicines are
not what they seem to be. Dr. J. H. Kellogg says
in his <i>Monitor of Health</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The average manufacturer of patent medicines regularly
employs a person of some literary attainment whose duty it is
to invent vigorous testimonials of sufferings relieved by Dr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>Charlatan’s universal panacea. In many instances persons are
hired to give testimonials, and answer letters of inquiry in such
a way as to encourage business. The shameless dishonesty
and ingenious villainy exhibited are beyond description.”</p></div>

<p>Recently an advertisement of one of these nostrums
stated in the headlines that said nostrum
was used in the Frances Willard Temperance Hospital,
Chicago. The testimonial appended purported
to be from a nurse in that hospital, <i>but the testimonial
did not state, as did the headlines</i>, that the preparation
was ever used in that hospital. The president
of the hospital board of trustees states that the
nurse positively denies having given any testimonial
to the company thus advertising. She did give one
to another patent medicine concern, but not to this,
and never said either was used in the hospital, nor
have they been. Suit could be brought for damages,
but unfortunately the patent medicine people
have unlimited money, and the hospital has not.</p>

<p>Early in the present year there appeared in many
daily papers a large advertising picture of a man
whose name was appended as a professional nurse of
a western city.</p>

<p>The following testimonial accompanied the picture:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Mr. &mdash;&mdash; of &mdash;&mdash;, who is a professional nurse of experience,
writes,&mdash;‘My friend is improving, thanks to &mdash;&mdash;, and
you. I am called on to nurse the sick of all classes. I recommend
---- to such an extent that I am nicknamed &mdash;&mdash;
(giving name of nostrum) by nearly everybody.’”</p></div>

<p>As the writer of this book was acquainted with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>physician residing in the small city mentioned in
the advertisement, she wrote to him, requesting that
he investigate this testimonial.</p>

<p>He replied that he found the chief part of the
advertisement, namely, that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was a professional
nurse, false; “First, by his own statement
as he told me this morning that he never claimed
to be a professional nurse. And my personal acquaintance
with him, as well as that of a number of
other physicians in our little city, and reliable men
and women of this community who are acquainted
with him, all testify to the same thing, namely;
that he is not a professional nurse, neither is he a
nurse, or even a reliable man. He is an innocent,
ignorant man, very close to the pauper class. He
told me when I read the commendation to which
his name is affixed, that it was all true except the
professional nurse part, and that was entirely false,
as stated above.”</p>

<p>As the picture was of a fine-looking, intelligent-appearing
man it probably was as <i>genuine</i> as the
testimonial.</p>

<p>The following was clipped from a copy of <i>Merck’s
Report</i>, April, 1899, a druggists’ paper published in
New York city:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>
<big><span class="smcap">Many Druggists Indignant.</span></big><br />
<br />
A PATENT-MEDICINE ADVERTISEMENT CONTAINS UNAUTHORIZED<br />
ENDORSEMENTS.</h4>

<p>“Fully a score of East-side druggists are up in arms over the
unauthorized use of their names in a full-page newspaper adver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>tisement
of a widely-known specific. This advertisement appeared
recently in certain New York daily papers, and retail
druggists who have made it a rule of their business never to
recommend any particular proprietary article, found themselves
quoted in unqualified laudation of the article so liberally advertised.
The names and addresses of the druggists were given
in full, and when several of the men quoted conferred together
they found that the most barefaced misrepresentation had been
resorted to.</p>

<p>“One of the pharmacists thus misrepresented, happened to be
Sidney Faber, the secretary of the Board of Pharmacy. He
was not selling this particular specific, and had never said a
word for or against it, nevertheless, six or eight lines of endorsement
of the article were directly attributed to him. He
called on some of his druggist neighbors whose names he saw
in the advertisement, and ascertained that they, too, had been
falsely and unwarrantably quoted. Mr. Faber promptly wrote
to the proprietors of the specific in question, and denounced the
published endorsements bearing his name, as a forgery. His
indignation was by no means appeased when he received a
letter from the proprietary concern, couched in the following
language: ‘We regret to learn that you have been annoyed by
any statements that have appeared in New York city papers.
We will forward your letter to them.’</p>

<p>“Within the past few days several of the druggists whose
names were used in this advertisement without authority, have
been considering the advisability of taking legal proceedings in
order to ascertain their rights in the matter. It is contrary to
pharmaceutical ethics for a pharmacist to specially endorse any
proprietary article, or patent medicine. Some of the offended
druggists propose to contribute to a fund for the purpose of
publicly, and widely, advertising this unwarranted use of their
names.”<br /><br /></p></div>

<p>When patent medicine advertisers would dare to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>resort to such a wholesale fraud as this, what may
they be expected to refrain from?</p>

<p>As an illustration of how commendations from
notable persons are sometimes obtained, the following
is cited: In the winter of 1899, appeared an
advertising picture of the lovely Christian lady
from Denmark, the Countess Schimmelmann, who
was spending some time in Chicago. Below her
picture were the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Adeline, Countess Schimmelmann, whose portrait is here
given, in a recent letter to the &mdash;&mdash; company, (mentioning
proprietors of nostrum) speaks of friends of hers who have
been benefited by &mdash;&mdash; (mentioning nostrum), and who first
advised her to recommend it to her sick friends.</p>

<p>“The Countess, as is well known, is a prominent member of
the Danish court. Her coming to this country has been much
talked of. Her real object is one of charity. She is stopping
in Chicago, <i>and from there writes her straightforward endorsement
of</i> &mdash;&mdash; (mentioning nostrum).”</p></div>

<p>The italics are the writer’s. The picture and the
testimonial were cut from the paper, and sent to
the countess, asking if she had so spoken of this
medicine, and, if so, did she, a strong total abstinence
woman, know that this mixture contains a
large percentage of alcohol.</p>

<p>She responded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Thank you for asking me about the enclosed. A white-ribbon
lady came and asked me if I would do her the great
kindness to recommend &mdash;&mdash; compound (made up of the
juice of celery). I said I could not personally recommend it
as I neither use, nor want, medicine. But some very reliable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>friends of mine (<i>temperance people</i>, and <i>true Christians</i>) told
me I would do a good thing in recommending it as they used
it, and found it excellent. Then I wrote the following: ‘I
myself cannot recommend &mdash;&mdash; compound as I do not suffer
from any of the ailments it is said to be good for, but reliable
friends of mine tell me that it is excellent, and I would do a
good thing in recommending it to my friends. Adeline, Countess
Schimmelmann.’</p>

<p>“I will only consent to the publishing of this letter if you
publish the <i>whole</i> letter, and no extract from it, as the white-ribbon
lady did for the &mdash;&mdash; compound.”</p></div>

<p>If a white-ribboner played this mean trick upon
this distinguished Christian worker she is unworthy
of membership in the Woman’s Christian
Temperance Union. It is more than likely that
the “white-ribbon lady,” was a paid advertising
agent of the patent medicine manufacturer, and
wore a white-ribbon to gain the confidence of the
Countess.</p>

<p>Whether patent medicine manufacturers know
how to doctor all ills to which human flesh is heir
may be doubted, but that their advertising agents
are skilful “doctors” of testimonials is very evident
to any one acquainted with the facts.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Charities of New
York city in a “Report on the use of so-called
Proprietary Medicines as Therapeutic Agents,”
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In connection with this subject it might be mentioned that,
for years past, the name of Bellevue Hospital has been taken
in vain by a number of persons and firms, without any authority
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>whatever. It is a common occurrence that samples of proprietary
medicines, foods, mineral waters, plasters, etc., etc. are
sent to the hospital, or to members of the house-staff for
‘trial,’ whereupon the subsequent advertisements of the
articles in question often assert that the latter are ‘used in
Bellevue Hospital,’ leaving the impression upon the mind of
the reader that the article, or articles, have been used with
the sanction of some member of the Medical Board. It is
probably impossible to find a remedy for this evil, from which
many other institutions of repute likewise suffer. To publish a
denial of such false assertions would only aggravate the evil.
The utmost that can be done appears to be, to caution the
medical staff against any entanglements with, or encouragement
of, the agents of the interested parties.”</p></div>

<p>This report, which was adopted by the Medical
Board of Bellevue Hospital, classifies proprietary
preparations as “Objectionable” or “Unobjectionable”
according to the following rules:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Unobjectionable preparations are those, the origin and
composition of which is not kept secret, and which are known
to serve a useful and legitimate purpose. Malted Milk is an
example. Objectionable proprietary preparations, by far the
largest group of the whole class, comprise all those which are
aimed at under the medical code of ethics under the term
’secret nostrum,’ which term may be more closely defined thus:</p>

<p>“A secret nostrum is a preparation, the origin or composition
of which is kept secret, the therapeutic claims for which
are unreasonable or unscientific, or which is not intended for a
legitimate purpose.</p>

<p>“Examples: The various ‘Soothing Syrups,’ ‘Female
Regulators,’ ‘Blood Purifiers,’ and thousands of others.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. A. Emil Hiss, Ph. G., says of the secrecy of
these preparations:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A secret compound with a meaningless title is presumptively
a fraud. Why a secret if not to permit extravagant, or
fraudulent, claims as to therapeutic merit? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The
ruling motive of the secret being essentially false and dishonest,
its employment in the interest of any remedy is clearly
a sufficient cause for its condemnation and ostracism.”</p></div>

<p>Mothers sometimes wonder why their boys take
so readily to cigarettes, or their daughters to cocaine,
never thinking that the soothing syrup, or cough
mixture given freely by themselves to their children
developed a craving for something stronger later
on. Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup, advertised for
years in church as well as secular papers as “invaluable
for children,” is cited in the report for
1888 of the Massachusetts State Board of Health
as containing opium; also Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral,
Dr. Bull’s Cough Syrup, Jayne’s Expectorant,
Hooker’s Cough and Croup Syrup, Moore’s Essence
of Life, Mother Bailey’s Quieting Syrup, and others
too numerous to mention. The report says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The sale of soothing syrups, and all medicines designed for
the use of children, which contain opium and its preparations
should be prohibited. Many would be deterred from using a
preparation known to contain opium, who would use without
question a soothing syrup recommended for teething children.”</p></div>

<p>Again, on page 149 the following is quoted from
a prominent physician:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Among infants, and in the early years of life, soothing
syrups are the cause of untold misery; for seeds are doubtlessly
sown in infancy only to bear the most pernicious fruit in adult
life. It is said that one of the best known soothing syrups con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>tains
from one to three grains of morphia to the ounce of
syrup. I believe that stringent legal measures should immediately
be taken to stop the sale of so-called soothing syrups
containing opium, morphia or codeine.”</p></div>

<p>The writer has known mothers so ignorant of the
nature of these soothing syrups as to deliberately
put the baby to sleep upon them in order to insure
relief from care for some hours.</p>

<p>Prof. J. Redding, M. D., says on this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“While it may be true that an adult, of his own free will, and
without incentive, or predisposing causes, does occasionally become
a drunkard, I am convinced that nine hundred and
ninety-nine out of every one thousand individuals who become
drunkards are made so in embryo, infancy, or childhood, by the
use of alcoholic decoctions, soothing syrups, opiates, calomel,
etc. which are given as medicines to allay pain, obtund nerve
sensibility, to cure the little sufferer of his <i>vital manifestations</i>,
of his <i>mental discomforts</i>, but leave the actual disease and its,
perhaps, putrid causation to time and debilitated vitality to
remove.”</p></div>

<p>Of the danger and harmfulness of patent cough
mixtures <i>The American Therapist</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Cough mixtures as a rule, do more harm than good. Nine
times out of ten the principal ingredient is opium. It is true
that opium may lessen the tendency to cough, but it does great
damage by arresting the normal secretions, and the system
becomes affected by the poisons from the kidneys, skin,
stomach, intestines and the mucous membrane lining the upper
air passages. Not only do these mixtures arrest every
secretion in the body, but they also show their deteriorating
and degrading effect through the stomach. They contain substances
which tend to disorder and derange digestion.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Several years ago the Post-Office Department at
Washington was led to take an interest in the question
of fraudulent “patent” medicines, and an examination
of many of these nostrums was undertaken by government
chemists. Fraud orders were issued against
some of the most flagrant offenders, forbidding them
the use of the mails. This has not done away with the
evil, however, for they usually move to another city,
and begin business again under another name.</p>

<p>The examinations made for the Post Office Department
revealed the fact that a great many of the so-called
medicines on the market were intoxicating beverages
in disguise. The Internal Revenue Department
then took up the matter and a long list of these beverage
medicines was sent out to internal revenue agents
with instructions that these must not be sold henceforth
unless by persons paying a special tax for the
sale of alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p>Some of the manufacturers of these nostrums
availed themselves of opportunity given to add a recognized
medicinal agent to their flavored alcohol and
water and such preparations were stricken from the
list of those requiring a whisky license for their sale.
Peruna and Hostetter’s Bitters were the best-known
of these. Peruna had been up to this time what government
chemists called “a cheap cocktail.” The report
of the pure food commissioner of North Dakota
for 1906 gives on page 157 an analysis of it as now
upon the market: “Alcohol by volume, 21.25 per
cent.; total solids, 3.846 per cent.; ash, .158 per cent.”
The report says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The only thing of a medicinal nature that we could find
in this preparation appeared to be a small amount of senna
combined with a bitters of some kind.”</p></div>

<p>Proprietary “Foods” have not escaped attention
from chemists. Dr. Charles Harrington, for several
years secretary of Massachusetts Board of Health,
was the first to publish an analysis of these preparations
showing their alcoholic strength and their small
nutritive content. He lists “foods” examined by him
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Liquid Peptonoids 23.03 alcohol; maximum amount recommended
will yield less than one ounce of nutriment per
day, and the equivalent of 3.50 oz. of whisky. Hemapeptone
10.60 alcohol; Hemaboloids 15.81 alcohol; the maximum dose
recommended yields about ¼ oz. of nutriment, and the equivalent
of about 1½ oz. of whisky daily. Tonic Beef 15.58
alcohol; doses recommended yield about ½ oz. nutriment
daily, and the equivalent of one ounce of whiskey. Mulford’s
Predigested Beef 19.72 alcohol; doses recommended
yield about 1¼ oz. nutriment daily, and the alcoholic equivalent
of about 6 oz. of whisky. There were “Foods” for the
sick examined which were non-alcoholic, but their nutritive
value was about nothing in comparison to their cost.”</p></div>

<p>The Committee on Pharmacy of the American
Medical Association reports on the following foods
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Carpanutrine 17.3 alcohol; Liquid Peptones (Lilly &amp; Co.)
22.0; Nutrient Wine of Beef Peptone (Armour) 21.5; Nutritive
Liquid Peptone 23.0; Panopepton 18.5; Peptonic Elixir
18.8; Tonic Beef 16.1. The report on these says: “There are
no fatty substances present in these products; their food
value from this point of view is, therefore, <i>nil</i><a name="Page_313t" id="Page_313t"></a><a href="#Page_313tn">.”</a></p></div>

<p>A prominent physician of Philadelphia said of these
“Foods” in the Journal of the A. M. A.:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I have long been convinced that many a patient has suffered
severely when preparations such as these were being
used, and that not a few of them have died, chiefly of starvation.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A very important disadvantage of these foods
is their alcoholic content. Even in the small doses customarily
used, the quantity of alcohol is often irritating to the stomach,
and may be disadvantageous in other ways.”</p></div>

<p>The Committee on Pharmacy also reported on cod-liver
oil preparations. They said: “A preparation
claiming to represent cod-liver oil which does not contain
oil in some form is fraudulent. Waterbury’s
Metabolized Cod-Liver Oil and Hagee’s Cordial of
Cod-Liver Oil are cited as examples. It is claimed
by the manufacturers that the latter represents 33 per
cent. of pure Norwegian cod-liver oil, but in neither
of these preparations did the tests made by the committee
show any oil. Analysis revealed sugar, alcohol,
and glycerine, none of which is contained in cod-liver
<a name="Page_314t" id="Page_314t"></a><a href="#Page_314tn">oil.”</a></p>

<p>Vinol is advertised as Wine of Cod-Liver Oil, but
is admittedly without oil, and according to analysis
contains 18.8 per cent. alcohol. Wampole’s Tasteless
Preparation of Cod-Liver Oil showed 20.05 per cent.
of alcohol.</p>

<p>Cod-Liver Oil is considerably out of date now as a
prescribed remedy because physicians have found that
it impairs appetite. Cream and fresh butter and olive
oil are advised instead.</p>

<p>Australia has been such a harvest field for patent
medicine manufacturers that a government commission
was appointed to study the subject. This commission
presented a voluminous report to the parlia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>ment
of 1907. This report gives an analysis of most
of the extensively advertised medicines. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills are said to be made of oil of juniper
1 drop, hemlock pitch 10 grains, potassium nitrate
5 grains, powdered fenugreek (Greek hay) 4 grains,
wheat flour 4 grains, maize starch 2 grains. The report
says: “The stuff is the cheapest kind of skin-plaster
made up into pills.” The seeds of fenugreek are used
mainly for poultices. Doan’s Dinner Pills contain two
drastic purgatives, podophyllin and aloin. Both of
these are dangerous drugs. Aloin frequently produces
hemorrhoids (piles). The <i>British Medical Journal</i>
says that the material in forty of the Kidney Pills and
four Dinner Pills would cost one English halfpenny
(one cent).</p>

<p>Vitae-Ore is given as consisting of ordinary sulphate
of iron (green vitriol) to which a little Epsom
salts has been added. Munyon’s Kidney Cure, which
claims to cure Bright’s disease, gravel, and all urinary
diseases, is given as composed entirely of sugar. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills are said to be an iron pill much
the same as the ordinary Blaud’s Pills which are sold
in drug-stores for half, or less than half, the price of
the proprietary article. (Iron is said by recent investigators
to be very injurious to the stomach.)</p>

<p>The Committee on Pharmacy of the American Medical
Association has analyzed many proprietary medicines;
from their reports the following analyses are
taken. “Health Grains,” which are claimed to be a
remedy for “Dyspepsia, Indigestion, Nervousness,
etc.,” were found to consist of 87.50 per cent. of coarse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>quartz sand, and 12.50 per cent. of rock candy and
syrup.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><a name="Page_316t" id="Page_316t"></a><a href="#Page_316tn">“Hoff’s</a> Consumption Cure consists essentially of sodium cinnamate
and extract of opium, a mixture at one time suggested
for the treatment of tuberculosis, but which has been
discarded by physicians. A medicine which depends on
opium for whatever therapeutic effect it may have is, when
sold indiscriminately to the laity, inherently vicious.”</p></div>

<p>Sartoin Skin Food for “sunburn, and all skin blemishes”
was made of Epsom salts colored with a pink
dye. The government prosecuted the company sending
out Epsom salts as a “food,” and they were fined
$20 for thus seeking to dupe silly women.</p>

<p>Malt extracts are very extensively used at the
present time, under the popular notion that they
are an aid to starch digestion. That they are a
product of the brewery has caused them to be
looked upon with suspicion by cautious people, but
the multitude has apparently given no thought, or
care, as to whether or not they may be alcoholic.
Dr. Charles Harrington presented the results of an
examination of these preparations at a meeting of
the Boston Society of Medical Sciences, held Nov.
17, 1896. The following is quoted from the journal
of the society for November, 1896:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Twenty-one different brands of liquid malt extract were
obtained and analyzed. That they were not true malt extracts
is shown by the fact that in no one was there the slightest diastatic
power; all were alcoholic, some being stronger than beer,
ale, or even porter. In a number of specimens a large amount
of salicylic acid was detected.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg, in commenting upon this report,
said in the Dec., 1896, <i>Bulletin of the A. M. T. A.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In the light of these facts, it is apparent that ale or lager
beer might as well be prescribed for a patient as these so-called
malt extracts, which are practically nothing more than concentrated
ale or lager.”</p></div>

<p>There are malt extracts, made up like honey, or
syrup, in consistency, which are valuable.</p>

<p>The following list of malt extracts, with accompanying
letter from Prof. Sharples, is taken from a
paper published by Hon. Henry H. Faxon, of
Quincy, Mass.:&mdash;<br /></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="ralign">“Boston, Mass., March 20, 1897.</span><br />
</p>

<p>“I enclose a list of the malt extracts examined in this office
during the past year or two. These samples were all in
original packages, obtained by officers in various parts of
Eastern Massachusetts. They probably very fairly represent the
various malt extracts on the market. I have added two
samples of Porter and one of Old Brown Stout for purposes of
comparison.</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, and the <i>British
Medical Temperance Review</i> have been calling attention
to the danger in coca wines. Intemperance
among invalids is said to be greatly on the increase
from the use of these wines. In every case the
basis of these preparations is strongly alcoholic
wine, ranging from 18 to 20 per cent. The coca
added is either the leaves, or liquid extract of coca,
or hydrochlorate of cocaine.</p>

<p>Dr. Frederic Coley says in the <i>British Medical
Journal</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Coca, and its chief alkaloid, cocaine, are drugs which possess
some power of removing the sense of fatigue, just as analgesics
remove the consciousness of pain. But they no more
remove the physical condition of muscles, and nerve centres,
of which the sense of pain gives us warning, than a dose of
morphine, which removes the pain of toothache, removes the offending
tooth, or even arrests the caries in it. The truth of
this will be obvious to any one who remembers enough of physio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>logy
to know what fatigue really means. A muscle which is
tired out is different chemically from the same muscle in its
more normal condition, when it is ready to respond vigorously
to ordinary stimuli. It has lost something, and is, besides, overcharged
(poisoned, in fact) with the products of its own activity,
and it can only be restored by a fresh supply of the material
which it requires, and the carrying away of the poisonous waste
products. Fatigue of nerve centres is no doubt strictly analogous
to fatigue of muscles.</p>

<p>“It is practically impossible for us, by voluntary exertion, to
reach the degree of absolute fatigue, which the physiologist produces
by electric stimulation of a nerve-muscle preparation.
The sense of fatigue becomes so intense that voluntary effort
cannot overcome it. So no man can produce asphyxia by
simply holding his breath, because the <i>besoin de respirer</i> becomes
irresistible; but it is quite possible for a narcotic to so
dull the sensory part of the respiratory reflex mechanism as to
permit asphyxia to take place.</p>

<p>“The sense of fatigue, and the <i>besoin de respirer</i> are both
Nature’s danger signals. Drugs which hide such signals from
us are a more than doubtful benefit. If it were possible for us
to suppose that a fraction of a grain of cocaine could afford to
exhausted nerve centres, and muscles, the nutriment which they
require for their restoration, and at the same time eliminate the
poisonous waste products, then it would be reasonable to prescribe
the drug for use by all who are overworked, and perhaps
suffering from the malnutrition consequent upon, ‘nervous
dyspepsia,’ as well as mere want of rest.</p>

<p>“In this go-ahead century it is no wonder that many are but
too ready to experiment with a drug which professes to be able
to remove fatigue, and to enable a man to go on working when,
without its aid, weariness had become unendurable. Cocaine
claims all this; and it is most dangerous just because, for a
time, it seems able to keep its promise. That is how victims to
cocainism are made. Let us be honest with our overworked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>patients, who want us to help them with drugs; let us tell them
that rest is the only safe remedy for weariness.</p>

<p>“To combine such a drug as coca, or cocaine, with an alcoholic
stimulant, is to multiply the dangers of cocainism by
those of alcoholism. It would be impossible to find terms sufficiently
severe in which to condemn the recklessness of those
who promiscuously recommend such a compound for all who
are overworked or debilitated. One firm actually has the assurance
to advertise a preparation of this kind as a remedy for
dipsomania. Truly this is casting out devils by Beelzebub, with
a vengeance. Invoking Beelzebub for such a purpose has
never been a success. And I suspect that any form of coca
wine will make a great many more dipsomaniacs than it will
cure.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Walter N. Edwards, F. C. S., says of coca
wines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These wines are sold as being useful in an immense variety
of ailments. The following are a few of the many that are
named upon the bottles or in the circulars accompanying
them:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%">
“Weakness after illness,<br />
“Nervous disorders,<br />
“Sleeplessness,<br />
“Influenza,<br />
“Whooping cough,<br />
“Exhaustion of mind and body,<br />
“Allays thirst,<br />
“Restores digestive function,<br />
“Enables great physical toil to be undergone,<br />
“Great value in excesses of all kinds,<br />
“General debility,<br />
“Prevents colds and chills,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>“Makes pure, rich blood,<br />
“Anæmia,<br />
“Invaluable after pleurisy, pneumonia, etc.,<br />
“Aid to the vocal organs.<br />
</p>

<p>“This is a fairly respectable list of complaints, and the very
fact that these preparations of coca wine are put forward as a
cure for so wide a range of various complaints is in itself a
condemnation of them.</p>

<p>“When any particular remedy is said to be of universal
application for a large number of different complaints it may be
looked upon with great suspicion.</p>

<p>“It must always be remembered that there is the commercial
side to this question. The proprietors have no particular
regard for the welfare of the people; their business is to make
a profit, and many of them gain enormous fortunes. By skilful
and lavish advertisements, and by carefully worded testimonials,
they appeal to the credulity of the public, and often deceive
even those who regard themselves as belonging to the
thinking classes.</p>

<p>“There are two specific dangers in regard to these wines.
They are ordinary wines, either port or sherry for the most
part, and therefore strongly alcoholic. The user of them is in
considerable danger of cultivating a taste for alcohol, and certainly,
there is the greatest possible danger to any one having
had the appetite, of reviving it.</p>

<p>“The dose is an elastic one, it can be repeated with considerable
frequency three or four times a day.</p>

<p>“What would be said of growing girls or youths having recourse
three or four times a day to the wine bottle? This is
exactly what they are doing when coca, and the so-called food
wines are placed in their hands as medicine. They like the
pleasant taste, there is the call of habit and appetite, and so
there arises the greatest possible danger of a general liking for
alcoholic liquors being set up. The ailing man or woman of
set years is in similar danger, for they are having recourse to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>alcohol when their powers of mind and body are to some extent
exhausted, and they are thus less able to resist the fascination
for alcohol that may so quickly be brought into existence.</p>

<p>“Another element of danger is that the recourse to coca and
kola is an attempt to get more out of the body, and the mind,
than nature intended. Overwork, overstrain, worry, all produce
exhaustion of physical and nervous power. Nature pulls us up
by asserting herself, and we feel run down and seedy, and, perhaps,
quite unwell. What is wanted is rest, proper diet, and
change. These would quickly be restorative, and once again
we should be fit for the duties of life.</p>

<p>“In a busy age there is the strongest possible temptation to
seek a restorative by some occult method, rather than to give
the rest and refreshment that nature demands. It is upon this
that the whole trade in these so-called restoratives depends.</p>

<p>“There is no food quality in alcohol, cocaine or kola,
but there is in them all a narcotizing influence that in its lesser
stages is hurtful, and in its greater stages disastrous.</p>

<p>“The cocaine habit may be cultivated as easily as the alcohol
habit, and the two forms of disease, alcoholism and cocainism,
are by no means rare. The great factor in each of them is the
loss of will power, and when that is accomplished the descent
to complete moral and physical ruin is quite easy.</p>

<p>“A pure and simple life, in accord with the laws of health
and hygiene, is the panacea both for the maintenance, and the
restoration of health, and that is what we should strive to aim
at, rather than having recourse to drugs that are not only ineffective,
but positively dangerous.”&mdash;<i>United Temperance Gazette.</i></p></div>

<p>In Dr. Milner Fothergill’s <i>Practioners’ Hand-book
of Treatment</i>, fourth edition, the following statement
is made:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Coca wine, and other medicated wines are largely sold to
people who are considered, and consider themselves, to be total
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>abstainers. It is not uncommon to hear the mother of a family
say, ‘I never allow my girls to touch stimulants of any kind,
but I give them each a glass of coca wine at 11 in the morning,
and again at bedtime.’ Originally coca wine was made from
coca leaves, but it is now commonly a solution of the alkaloid,
in a sweet and strongly alcoholic wine. This is really the gist
of the whole matter; coca wine is largely consumed by people
who fondly believe themselves to be total abstainers, and who
are active enough in denouncing those who take a little wine, or
a glass of beer at their meals. The sooner their delusion is
dispelled the better for themselves, and for the unfortunate
children over whom they exercise supervision.”</p></div>

<p>Another physician tells of seeing a distinguished
ecclesiastical dignitary, a sworn foe of alcohol and
its congeners, giving his young child a generous
daily allowance of one of these wines.</p>

<p>The user of coca wines runs a double risk&mdash;an
alcohol craving may be revived, or created; and, at
the same time, cocainism may be set up, and
nothing but physical, mental and moral ruin follow.</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i> of January 23rd,
1897, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There can be no doubt that in many parts of the world cocaine
inebriety is largely on the increase. The greatest number
of victims is to be found among society women, and among
women who have adopted literature as a profession; and there
is no doubt that a considerable proportion of chronic cocainists
have fallen under the dominion of the drug from a desire to
stimulate their powers of imagination. Others have acquired
that habit quite innocently from taking coca wines. The symptoms
experienced by the victims of the cocaine habit are illusions
of sight and hearing, neuromuscular irritability, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>localized anæsthesia. After a time insomnia supervenes, and
the patient displays a curious hesitancy, and an inability to arrive
at a decision on even the most trivial subjects.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. F. Coley says later on in the article before
referred to:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is another combination which, though utterly absurd
from a therapeutical point of view, is not in itself quite so dangerous
as coca wine. It will probably do a larger amount of
mischief, however, because more people take it. I refer to the
various preparations, so largely advertised, which profess to be
compounded of port wine, extract of malt, and extract of meat.
To the medically uneducated public this doubtless seems a most
promising combination: extract of meat for food, extract of
malt to aid digestion, port wine to make blood. Surely the very
thing to strengthen all who are weak, and to hasten the restoration
of convalescents. Unfortunately what the advertisements
say&mdash;that this stuff is largely prescribed by medical men&mdash;is not
wholly untrue.</p>

<p>“I do not suppose that any physician of anything like front
rank would make such a mistake. But busy general practitioners
may be excused if they prove to be a bit oblivious of physiology,
and so become attracted by a formula which is more
plausible than sound. In the first place, we all know that extract
of meat is not food at all. From the manner of its production,
it cannot contain an appreciable quantity of proteid
material. It consists mainly of creatin, and creatinin, and salts.
These are, it is needless to say, incapable of acting as food.
Extract of meat, and similar preparations, have their uses however;
made into ‘beef-tea,’ their meaty flavor often enables
patients to take a quantity of bread, which would otherwise be
refused; or lentil flour, or some other matter may be added.
In this way, though not food itself, it becomes a most useful
aid to feeding. It is besides, a harmless stimulant, especially
when taken, as it always should be, hot. It should be needless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>to add that to combine extract of meat with port wine is simply
to ignore its real use. The only intelligible basis for such an
invention must be the wholly erroneous notion that extract of
meat is a food.”</p></div>

<p>The prices asked for “secret nostrums” are
said by chemists to be ofttimes far beyond the value
of the materials. Of one article the <i>New Idea</i>, a
druggists’ paper, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It retails at $1.50 per bottle. Such an article could be put
up for less than fifteen cents, including bottle, leaving by no
means a small margin for the profit of its manufacturers.”</p></div>

<p>The same paper says of a cure for catarrh,
neuralgia, etc. sold in the form of a small ball:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“This cure costs $2.50 per ball. A handsome profit could
be made upon it at 5 cents a ball.”</p></div>

<p>Some proprietary preparations are not harmful,
but are positively inert. The Mass. State Board of
Health in report of 1896 gives <i>Kaskine</i> as an example
of these. Although sold at a dollar an ounce
it was found to consist of nothing but granulated
sugar of the fine grade used in homeopathic pharmacy,
without any medication or flavoring whatever.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Von Adelung in an article in <i>Life
and Health</i>, Dec., 1897, tells of a well advertised
cure for consumption, the analysis of which showed
it to be composed of water, slightly colored by the
addition of a very small quantity of red wine, and
two mineral acids, muriatic and impure sulphuric,
in quantities just sufficient to lend it a taste! He
says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Fortuitously I had the opportunity of observing the influence
of this remedy on a consumptive who took it regularly, and
who was so enamored of its favorable action that he gave up
his business to conduct an agency for its sale. It was not long
after he had entered upon his new vocation that I received
word of his death, due to pulmonary hemorrhage.”</p></div>

<p>The “returned missionary” fraud has been exposed
by different druggists’ papers, among them
the <i>New Idea</i>. The “missionary” would advertise
a “free cure,” if people would send to him. The
“cure” would be in the form of a prescription.
There being no drugs in any drugstore bearing the
names given in the prescription, the dupe was expected
to pay an exorbitant price for them to the
philanthropic “missionary.” In one case of this
kind the “medicinal plants brought from South
America, the only place where they grew,” were
upon examination by chemists of the <i>New Idea</i>
found to be ordinary drugs, not one of which
comes from South America.</p>

<p>The same paper tells of another “South American”
fraud, 60,000 bottles of which were said to be
sold in Detroit in a few weeks, by an itinerating
vendor.</p>

<p>A certain liver, and kidney, and constipation
cure, sold in the form of herbs, is said by <i>New Idea</i>
to be chiefly couch grass, and senna leaves. Yet
it sells for 25 cents for a small package.</p>

<p>To this paper the public is also indebted for the
information that a kind of wafer advertised to “cure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>in a few days all coughs, colds, irritation of the
uvula and tonsils, influenza, bronchitis, asthma, sore
throat, consumption, and all diseases of the lungs
and chest” was found to consist wholly of sugar and
corn starch!</p>

<p><i>Medical World</i> recently told of the investigation
of “H&mdash;&mdash;” by Prof. John Uri Lloyd of Cincinnati.
It was advertised as a plant discovered by a doctor
traveling in Florida. Its juices were said to be
antidotal to snake poisoning, and would also cure
the opium habit. Prof. Lloyd found it to be a liquid
consisting of a solution of sulphate of morphine
and salicylic acid, in alcohol and glycerine,
with suitable coloring matter.</p>

<p>Another fraud exposed by <i>New Idea</i> was a
“cure” for the peculiar ills of women. The cure is
put up in the form of little oblong blocks about a
half inch in length.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A circular accompanies them, and is well calculated to produce
alarm in the young. It is another sample of the demoralizing
documents which unscrupulous quacks are continually
circulating among the laity, in order to create alarm, and
profit by this alarm.”</p></div>

<p>After giving a description of the diseases peculiar
to the sex it is stated that all of these are curable
by using eight dollars worth of this wonderful medicine.</p>

<p><i>New Idea</i> continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The <i>cure</i> consists, according to our examination, of nothing
but flour, made into a paste and allowed to harden in the form
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>of small oblong blocks. Evidently the quack relied upon the
faith-cure principle, and his auxiliary treatment, as set forth in
the rules of living given in the circular.”</p></div>

<p>While these inert preparations are of the nature
of frauds, they will not injure the health, nor make
drunkards, or opium fiends, as the disguised preparations
of whisky and morphine are likely to do.</p>

<p>That the use of patent medicines has made many
drunkards is a fact well attested. The American
Association for the Study of Inebriety appointed a
committee several years ago to investigate the various
nostrums advertised especially for the benefit of
alcohol and opium inebriates. The report of this
committee, prepared by Dr. N. Roe Bradner, late
of the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, in
speaking of the marvelous cures advertised in connection
with the use of these mixtures, calls them
“volumes of gilded falsehood, designed for an innocent,
unsuspecting public,” and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The use of such nostrums would do more toward confirming
than eradicating the habit, if it existed, and would invite
and create addiction to an almost hopeless fatality, where the
habit had not previously existed. Insanity, palsy, idiocy, and
many forms of physical, moral and mental ruin have followed
the sale of these nostrums throughout our land.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. E. A. Craighill, President of the Virginia
State Pharmaceutical Association, is quoted in the
July (1897) <i>Journal of Inebriety</i>, as saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In my experience I have known of men filling drunkards’
graves who learned to drink taking some advertised bitters as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>legitimate medicine. It would be hard to estimate the number
of young brains ruined, and the maturer opium wrecks from
nostrums of this nature. I could write a volume on the mischief
that is being done every day to body, mind and soul, all
over the land, by the thousands of miserable frauds that are being
poured down the throats of not only ignorant people, but,
alas, intelligent ones, too.”</p></div>

<p>A lady informed the writer recently that her
brother had taken forty bottles of one of these
preparations, and had become a drunkard through it.</p>

<p>Many seem unaware that the ethics of the medical
profession restrain reputable physicians from advertising
themselves or their remedies, so that these
much-lauded patent medicines are put upon the
market by quacks, never by physicians of good
standing. It is purely a money-making enterprise,
without consideration of the health or destruction
of the people. It is popularly supposed that physicians
decry these things from fear that their sale
will injure regular practice. This is another error
as they increase work for the doctor by aggravating
existing trouble, as well as causing disease where
there was only slight disturbance.</p>

<p>Dr. F. E. Stewart, Ph. G., of Detroit, Mich., says
in the October, 1897, <i>Life and Health</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Taking all these facts into consideration, it is apparent that
the patent, trade-mark and copyright laws should be so interpreted
and administered by the court that they will secure the
greatest good to the greatest number, and aid in attaining the
end of government, viz., ‘moral, intellectual and physical perfection.’
It is not the object of these laws to create odious mon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>opolies,
to throw a mantle of protection over fraud, to enable
quacks and charlatans to encroach on the domain of legitimate
medical and pharmacal practice, or to support an advertising
business designed to mislead the public in regard to the nature
and value of medicines as curative agents. The morals of the
community are injured by some of this advertising, intellectual
vigor is impaired by the use of many things advertised, and
physical, as well as moral, degradation frequently results. Crime
is often inculcated&mdash;even the crime of murder, that the nostrum
manufacturer may profit thereby. Cures for incurable diseases
are promised, and guaranteed. Every scheme that human and
devilish ingenuity can devise to wring money from its victim is
resorted to, which can be employed without actually bringing
the advertisers into court. All this wicked quackery parades
under the guise of ‘patent’ medicines, and asks the protection
of our courts. It is time for the medical and pharmaceutic professions
to unite, and unmask this monster, and show the public
its true nature. And this can be accomplished in no better way
than through a study of the object of the laws which the secret
nostrum manufacturers are now endeavoring to prostitute for
their own advantage, and the teaching of the public what these
laws were enacted for.</p>

<p>“The secret nostrum business in some of its phases has assiduously
found its way into the medical arts, and physicians,
pharmacists, and manufacturing houses, seem to have forgotten,
to a certain extent, the obligations which they owe to the public.
Medicine, in all its departments, must be practiced in accord
with scientific, and professional requirement, or it will sink to
the level of a commercial business. <i>The end of medical practice
is service to suffering humanity, not the acquisition of
money.</i> Money making is a necessary part of the practice of
medical arts, not, however, its chief object. This fact must be
kept in view always. Once lost sight of, and trade competition
substituted for competition in serving the interests of the sick,
medical and pharmacal practice will become an ignoble scrabble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>for wealth, in which the sick become victims of avarice and
greed. Better set free a pack of ravening wolves in a community
than to change the end of medical practice to a commercial
one, for physicians and pharmacists would soon degenerate
into quacks and charlatans, and take shameful advantage of
the community for gain.”</p></div>

<p>Where Dr. Stewart speaks of murder he probably
refers to the sale of <i>abortofacients</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Roe Bradner, of Philadelphia, in his report
upon alleged cures for drunkenness before the Society
for the Study of Inebriety several years ago,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There is a certain other class of so-called remedies, prepared
sometimes by physicians and pharmacists, that do a great
deal of harm. I allude to the ‘non-secret proprietaries’ that
claim to publish their formulas, <i>but do not</i>. One in particular
has made thousands, and likely tens of thousands, of <i>chloral
drunkards</i>, dethroned the reason of as many more, besides
having killed outright very many. It is impossible for any one
to estimate the mischief that is being done by such remedies,
and the physicians who recommend them.”</p></div>

<p>Advertising is still the great hindrance in protecting
the people from medical imposters. Professor
E. W. Ladd, Pure Food Commissioner of North
Dakota, says on this point:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These patent medicines, some of which are of merit, and
others are only ‘dopes,’ or preparations intended to defraud
the public, have been altogether too generally advertised and
sold to the public. In many ways it seems a deplorable fact
that by an unfair method of advertising the American people
have come to be consumers to such an extent of a class
of medicines, which, at times, are positively detrimental to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>health. In other instances the continued use of the product
is liable to result in the formation of a drug habit which
may lead to serious consequences.</p>

<p>“It should not be understood that this department condemns
the use of legitimate proprietary or patent medicines,
but it insists that there is a need for wiping out of existence
about half of the products now generally sold, and with regard
to the others the public have a right to know what is
contained in them, and not be misled by false statements, or
by statements so cunningly worded as to positively mislead
the unwary reader. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* In view of the fact that about 90
per cent. of the nostrums on the market are sold by newspaper
and magazine advertising and not by the customer
seeing the package, it would seem advisable to amend the
law so as to cover this point.”</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that it is the advertising which
makes the patent medicine business so tremendously
profitable. One firm boasted, prior to the exposure
of the fraud nature of their preparation, that they
spent $5,000 a day in advertising. What must have
been made on the nostrum to allow such expenditure?
It is said on good authority that the cost of these nostrums
does not exceed fifteen to sixteen cents a bottle,
and they sell for a dollar a bottle. Such profits make
it easy to buy up newspapers that are conscienceless
as to the robbery of the unfortunate sick.</p>

<p>The only effectual way of putting an end to the
sale of nostrums is to make illegal the advertising of
such preparations in the public press. Norway has
safeguarded her people thus. The difficulty in gaining
such a law in America will be the opposition of the
newspapers, the large majority of which still cling to
this selfish method of adding to their gains. Even the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>so-called religious press is not all clean yet in this
respect. Once they could be excused because of lack
of knowledge. Now there is no excuse.</p>

<p>During the debate in Congress upon the patent-medicine
clause of the Pure Food Bill, Senator Heyburn
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I have always been aggressively against the advertisements
of nostrums. Some time ago a friend of mine, a
very old fellow, that I had taken a special interest in securing
a pension for, had reached the age and condition of dependency.
I succeeded in getting him a comfortable pension
that would pay his bills for household provisions. Once,
when I found he was very poor, I said to his wife, ‘What are
you doing with your pension?’ She said, ‘Don’t you know,
Mr. Heyburn, that it takes at least one-half of that pension
for patent medicine?’ Then she enumerated the patent medicines
they were taking. It was being suggested to them
through advertisements that they were the victims of ills
that they were not troubled with, and that they could find
relief through these different medicines.</p>

<p>“I am in favor of stopping the advertisements of these nostrums
in every paper in the country.”</p></div>

<p>It may well be asked, Would any one of these well-to-do
newspaper owners entrust himself, or any of
his family, in time of sickness to the cure-all imposters
whose nostrums they advertise? If one of their
children had anæmia would they rely on Pink Pills
for a cure? If they had a genuine catarrh would they
expect it to be cured by Peruna? Never! They
would seek the very best medical advice obtainable.
Yet, for the ignorant, credulous, sick and suffering
poor they allow traps to be laid to rob of both money
and such chances of recovery as might come from
proper medical attendance.</p>

<h3>“DRUGGING.”</h3>


<p>The main reason why so many people use patent
medicines is the popular supposition that drugs
cure disease. This is a great error. <i>Drugs never
cure disease.</i> Nature alone has power to heal.
There are agents, which in the hands of a trained
and painstaking physician may assist nature, but
the physician needs to understand something of the
idiosyncrasies of his patient’s system, or the use of
these agents may do great harm instead of good.
Those medical men who have made the most diligent
study of health and disease assert as their
deliberate opinion that excessive professional drugging
has been decidedly destructive of human life.</p>

<p>Dr. Jacob Bigelow, professor in the medical
department of Harvard University, in a work
published a few years ago stated as his belief that
the unbiased opinion of most medical men of sound
judgment, and long experience, is that the amount
of death and disaster in the world would be less, if
all diseases were left to themselves, than it now is
under the multiform, reckless, and contradictory
modes of practice, with which practitioners of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>diverse denominations carry on their differences, at
the expense of the patient.</p>

<p>Sir John Forbes, M. D., F. R. S., said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Some patients get well with the aid of medicine, more
without it, and still more in spite of it.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Bostwick, author of <i>The History of Medicine</i>,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Every dose of medicine given is a blind experiment upon
the vitality of the patient.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. James Johnson, editor of the <i>Medico-Chirurgical
Review</i>, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I declare as my conscientious conviction founded on long
experience and reflection, that if there were not a single physician,
surgeon, man-midwife, chemist, apothecary, druggist
nor drug on the face of the earth, there would be less sickness
and less mortality than now prevail.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. J. W. Carson, of the New York College of
Physicians and Surgeons, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“We do not know whether our patients recover because we
give them medicine, or because nature cures them. Perhaps
bread-pills would cure as many as medicine.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. Alonzo Clark, of the same college, has
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In their zeal to do good physicians have done much harm;
they have hurried many to the grave who would have recovered
if left to nature.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. Martin Paine, of the New York University
Medical College, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Drug medicines do but cure one disease by producing
another.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Marshall Hall, F. R. S.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Thousands are annually slaughtered in the quiet sick-room.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Adam Smith:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The chief cause of quackery <i>outside</i> the profession is the
<i>real</i> quackery <i>in</i> the profession.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. Gilman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The things that are administered for the cure of <i>scarlet
fever</i> and <i>measles</i> kill far more than those diseases kill.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. Barker, of New York Medical College:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The drugs that are administered for the cure of <i>scarlet
fever</i> kill far more patients than the disease does.”</p></div>

<p>Prof. Parker:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“As we place more confidence in nature, and less in preparations
of the apothecary, mortality diminishes.”</p></div>

<p>The examining physician of a large insurance
company in New York said to a <i>Mercury</i> reporter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The primary cause of so many cases of <i>la grippe</i> in this
and other cities is the almost universal habit of drug taking
from the milder tonics to patent medicines. Whenever the
average man or woman feels depressed or slightly ill, resort is
made at once to medicine, more or less strong. If they would
try to find out the cause of the trouble, and seek to obviate it
by regulating their mode of living, the general health of the
community would be better. The drug habit tends continually
to lower the tone of the system. The more it is indulged in
the more apparent becomes the necessity of continuing the
downhill course. The majority of persons do not look beyond
the fact that they seem to feel better after the use of a stimulating
drug, or patent medicine. This feeling comes from a be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>numbing
action of the drug, because it has no uplifting action.
With the system in such a weakened state, the microbes of the
disease find excellent ground to grow.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. J. H. Kellogg says in the April, 1899, <i>Bulletin
of the A. M. T. A.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Every drug capable of producing an artificial exhilaration of
spirits, a pleasure which is not the result of the natural play of
the vital functions, is necessarily mischievous in its tendencies,
and its use is intemperance, whether its name be alcohol, tobacco,
opium, cocaine, coca, kola, hashish, Siberian mushroom,
caffeine, betel-nuts, maté or any other of the score or more
enslaving drugs known to pharmacology. As the result of the
depression which follows the unnatural elevation of sensation
resulting from the use of one of these drugs, the second application
finds the subject on a little lower level than the first, so
that an increased dose is necessary to produce the same intensity
of pleasure or the same degree of artificial felicity as the
first. The larger dose is followed by still greater depression
which demands a still larger dose as its antidote, and thus there
is started a series of ever-increasing doses, and ever-increasing
baneful after-affects, which work the ultimate ruin of the drug
victim. All drugs which enslave are alike in this regard, however
much they may differ otherwise in their physiological effects.
Alcohol is universally recognized as only one member of
a large family of intoxicating drugs, each of which is capable
of producing specific functional and organic mischief, besides
the vital deterioration common to the use of so-called felicity-producing
drugs.</p>

<p>“Is it not evident, then, that in combating the use of alcohol
we are attacking only one member of a numerous family of
enemies to human life and happiness, every one of which must
be exterminated before the evil of intemperance will be up-rooted?”</p></div>

<p>Among the most popular drugs for self-prescrip<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>tion
at the present time are the coal-tar products.
Of these Dr. N. S. Davis has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Only a few years since, the profession were taught to regard
the degree of pyrexia, or heat, as the chief element of
danger in all the acute general diseases. Consequently, to control
the pyrexia became the leading object of treatment; and
whatever would do this promptly, and at the same time allay
pain and promote rest, found favor at the bedside of the patient.</p>

<p>“It was soon ascertained that antipyrin, antifebrin, phenacetin
and other analogous products, if given in sufficient doses, would
reduce the heat, and allay the pains with great certainty and
promptness, not only in continued fevers, but also in rheumatism,
influenza, or la grippe, etc.; and thus their use soon became
popular with both the profession and the public. No one,
however, undertook to first ascertain by strictly scientific
appliances the actual pathological processes causing the pyrexia
in each form of disease, or even to determine whether in any
given case the increased heat was the result of increased heat
production, or diminished heat dissipation. Neither were any
of the remedies subjected to such experimental investigation as
to determine their influence on the elements of the blood, the
internal distribution of oxygen, the metabolism of the tissues,
or on the activity of the eliminations. Consequently their
exhibition was wholly empirical, and the one that subdued the
pyrexia most promptly was given the preference. Yet we all
know that the pyrexia invariably returned as soon as the effects
of each dose were exhausted, and in a few years the results
showed that while the antipyretics served to keep down the
pyrexia, and give each case the appearance of doing well, the
average duration of the cases, and their mortality, were both increased.</p>

<p>“Step by step experimental therapeutic investigations have
proved that the whole class of coal-tar antipyretics reduce ani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>mal
heat by impairing the capacity of the hemoglobin and corpuscular
elements of the blood to receive and distribute free
oxygen, and thereby reduce temperature by diminishing heat
production, nerve sensibility and tissue metabolism. Therefore,
while each dose temporarily reduces the fever, it retards
the most important physiological processes on which the living
system depends for resisting the effects of toxic agents; namely,
oxidation and elimination. This not only encourages the retention
of toxic agents and natural excretory materials by which
specific fevers are protracted, but it greatly increases the number
of cases of pneumonia that complicate the epidemic influenza,
or la grippe, as it has occurred since 1888-89.</p>

<p>“The bad work that people make in dosing themselves with
patent medicines, without a physician’s prescription is not unfrequently
punctuated with a sudden death from overdosing
with antipyrin, sulphonal, or some other coal-tar preparation.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. C. H. Shepard, Brooklyn, N. Y., says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Quinine is a most fatal drug. Of course, it is the orthodox
treatment for malarial conditions, but quinine never did nor
never can cure malaria or any other disease. The action
brought about by its use is simply to benumb the nervous
activity and interfere with the natural action of the system to
throw off the poison, which is expressed by the chill. Because
of this interference with the manifestation or symptom of the
disease, many imagine that the disease is being cured, but
there never was a greater mistake. A drug disease is added to
the original disease. This is shown by the invariable depression
that follows the administration of the drug, and the length
of time required to recuperate, which imperils restoration, and
sometimes hastens the final results. This is ordinarily met by
the use of what are called stimulants, that is, more drugs, and the
last state is worst than the first; the poor patient is thus made
the victim of a triple wrong, which only a most vigorous consti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>tution
can pass through and live, and even then he is crippled
and made more liable to whatever disease may come along
ever afterward.</p>

<p>“Disease is not entity to be killed by a shot from a professional
gun, but a condition, an effort of outraged nature to free
itself from an incumbrance, and should be aided rather than
hindered by the administration of any nerve irritant. There
never will come a time when the laws of health can be evaded.
Nor is there any vicarious atonement. The full penalty of disobedience
will invariably be exacted. The hunt for a panacea is
as sure to be disappointing in the future as it has been in the
past.”</p></div>

<p>A writer in the <i>Brooklyn Citizen</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Few people are aware of the extent of a peculiar kind of
dissipation known as ginger-drinking. The article used is the
essence of ginger, such as is put up in the several proprietary
preparations known to the trade, or the alcohol extract ordinarily
sold over the druggist’s counter. Having once acquired a liking
for it, the victim becomes as much a slave to his appetite as the
opium eater or the votary of cocaine. In its effect it is much
the most injurious of all such practices, for in the course of
time it destroys the coating of the stomach, and dooms its victim
to a slow and agonizing death.</p>

<p>“The druggist who told me about the thing says that as
ginger essence contains about one hundred per cent. alcohol,
and whisky less than fifty per cent., the former is therefore
twice as intoxicating. In fact, this is the reason why it is used
by hardened old topers whose stomachs are no longer capable
of intoxicating stimulation from whisky. They need the more
powerful agency of the pure alcohol in the ginger extract. He
told me that he had two regular customers, one a woman, who
had ginger on several occasions for stomachic pains. The relief
it afforded her was so grateful that she took it upon any
recurrence of her trouble. She found, too, that the slight ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>hilaration
of the alcohol banished mental depression. In this
way she got to using it regularly, and finally to such excess
that she was often grossly intoxicated. Large doses produce a
quiet stupor; additional doses induce a profound lethargic
slumber, which lasts in some cases for twenty-four hours. His
other customer was a peddler, who came at a certain hour
every morning, bought a four-ounce bottle and drank its contents
by noon. The man craved the stuff so ardently that he
was unable to go about his business until he set the machinery
of his stomach in operation, and started the circulation of the
blood by means of the fiery draught. He says that the habit
is well known to the drug trade.”</p>

<p>“The morphia habit, the cocaine habit, the chloral habit, and
other poison habits which are prevalent in this and other
countries, are only different manifestations of a wide-spread
and apparently increasing love for drugs which benumb or excite
the nerves, which seems to characterize our modern civilization.
Indeed, there appears to be, at the present time,
almost a mania for the discovery of some new nerve-tickle, or
some novel means of fuddling the senses. It is indeed high
time that the medical profession raised, with one accord, its
voice in solemn protest against the use of all nerve-obtunding
and felicity-producing drugs, which are all, without exception,
toxic agents, working mischief and only mischief in the human
body.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. H. Kellogg.</span></p></div>

<p>Much discussion upon careless drug-taking has
resulted from remarks made recently in London by
Sir Frederick Treves, the King’s surgeon, at the opening
of a hospital. He said that the time is fast
approaching when physicians will give very little medicine,
but will instead teach the people right methods
of living so that sickness may be avoided.</p>

<p>Although there are some physicians who appear to
enjoy the old routine of giving heroic doses of ill-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>tasting
liquids, there are others who agree with Sir
Frederick, and admit that they would often be glad
to give no medicine if their patients would be satisfied
without it. But the great mass of people are unwilling
to take a physician’s advice as to proper clothing,
suitable diet, and regular habits of living. They do not
seek his advice upon those points; what they want is a
drug that will benumb uneasy sensations while they
live as they please.</p>

<p>Not long ago a business man of intelligence was
heard to complain because he had tried several physicians
and all had failed to cure his sciatica. He said
they all told him he must live differently; several said
he must quit smoking and lay aside wine and beer
or he could not be cured. With scorn he said, “What
are physicians good for if they don’t know a drug
that will cure as simple a thing as rheumatism?” He
could not and would not believe that rheumatism might
be the result of his wrong habits.</p>

<p>Akin to him in thought is a woman, much above the
average in intelligence, who a few months ago had an
operation performed upon her stomach. The stomach
was enlarged so that the food did not pass through the
pylorus, the opening into the intestines. The operation
consisted in making a new opening and connecting
it with an intestine. This bright woman now complains
that the operation was not a success, because she
still has times of great distress with indigestion. Upon
being asked what she eats, she laughed and said,
“Everything, peanuts, mince-pie, sauer-kraut, frankforts;
whatever is going. I have a vigorous appetite,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>and keep peanuts and figs in my room, for I often
have to eat in the night.”</p>

<p>Until multitudes of people like that business man,
and that bright woman, are educated in matters of
health, it will not be easy for physicians to bring Sir
Frederick’s prediction to fulfilment.</p>

<p>The popular supposition is that drugs <i>cure</i> disease,
and all that the medical adviser is for is to choose the
drug that will produce the desired effect with the greatest
speed. Consequently the physician is in many
cases driven to prescribe drugs that simply allay pain
without removing the cause of the pain. He cannot
remove the cause without the patient’s co-operation,
and as that would require the abandonment of wrong
habits few are willing to accept health at such a price.
What man will abandon beer to escape rheumatism,
or smoking to save his eyesight if he has weakness
there? Or, what woman will cease tea-drinking if she
has neuralgia?</p>

<p>The <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
for November 16, 1907, contained an editorial article
in which, after reference to drugs necessary in the
practice of a physician or surgeon, this is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The remark of Holmes years ago that it would be better
for the patients, but worse for the fish, if most of the drugs
were thrown into the sea, is probably even more true to-day.
The vast majority of these drugs have not the slightest excuse
for existence.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers, in his valuable book upon Morphinism
and other drug addictions, reports a case of
murder where it was shown that the assailant was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>delirious from large doses of quinine. He says assaults
are often clearly traced to the drug taking of
the assailant. A surgeon from a New York hospital,
in speaking of drug habits before an audience at Chautauqua,
New York, said that some of the ovarian
difficulties which demand operations are the result of
over-dosing with quinine.</p>

<p>There are people who keep morphine in the house
all the time lest some little pain or ache should find
them unprepared.</p>

<p>Dr. Crothers, who has perhaps made more of a
study of the evil results of drug taking than any other
man in America, says of this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Morphine as a common remedy, taken for pains and aches,
may suddenly develop into an incurable craze for its continuous
use. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The early relief which morphine brings
to the sufferer is often the beginning of an unknown journey
ending in disease and death.”</p></div>

<p>Cases are on record where morphine given to mothers
soon after the birth of children to allay pain, has
resulted in the death of the infant, the morphine having
poisoned the milk.</p>

<p>Cocaine is possibly the most insidious of all drugs
yet known. Few of those who become enslaved to it
ever are able to lay it aside. It leads to hallucinations
of sight and hearing. Many persons have become enslaved
to cocaine unwittingly through its use in catarrh
snuffs, asthma “cures,” and other proprietary preparations,
the composition of which was secret. Some
states now have strict laws regulating the sale of this
dangerous drug.</p>

<p>It is not only the enslaving drugs which are injuri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>ous
to the body, but even such apparently simple agents
as liver pills and pills for the relief of constipation
may do more harm than good if resorted to frequently.
Some of the ingredients used in the pills for the relief
of constipation are said to be injurious to the liver.</p>

<p>Dr. Nathan S. Davis, late dean of the Northwestern
University Medical School, Chicago, said of the coal-tar
remedies, such as phenacetin and antipyrin, in
the treatment of influenza and <i>la grippe</i>:&mdash;“While
each dose temporarily reduces the fever it retards the
most important physiological processes on which the
living system depends for resisting the effects of toxic
agents, namely, oxidation and elimination. This not
only encourages the retention of poisonous agents by
which fevers are protracted, but it greatly increases
the number of cases of pneumonia that complicate
<i>la grippe</i>. The bad work that people make in dosing
themselves with patent medicines is not infrequently
punctuated with a sudden death from overdosing with
antipyrin, sulphonal, or some other coal-tar preparation.”</p>

<p>Deaths from acetanilid are becoming more and more
frequent. The presence of acetanilid in headache
powders “guaranteed to be harmless” and thrown
upon the door-steps as samples has led many persons
into grave danger, and not a few to death. Bromo-Seltzer,
Orangeine, Antikamnia, Taylor’s Headache
Powders, and various other preparations have all
contained this drug.</p>

<p>The use of cocaine is advancing rapidly in this<a name="TNanchor_1" id="TNanchor_1"></a><a href="#TN_1">[TN]</a>
country. The following article is taken from <i>The
Banner of Gold</i>, of Feb., 1899:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In these simple figures are contained the elements of a
warning sermon that would startle all America. We seem to
be rapidly becoming a nation of cocaine fiends. If the number
of those addicted to the use of the dreadful drug continues to
increase at the present rate, the importation of what was originally
regarded as a blessed alleviation of pain, will have to be
classed with opium, and its use prohibited by law, except for
medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>“At present the cocaine fiend can purchase the drug without
trouble, and the ease with which it is taken is a fatal recommendation
to those who crave a nerve-deadener. No laborious
cooking of pills over a lamp, cleaning of implements, or troublesome
necessity for secrecy, as with the use of opium. Cocaine
can be taken at any time, with scarcely any trouble, and without
a soul besides the user being aware of his being in the toils.</p>

<p>“At first, that is. It will not be long before every intimate
friend will observe a change, a gradual and scarcely perceptible
change, come over the appearance and general conduct of the
cocaine fiend.</p>

<p>“Begun in many cases in a legitimate way, as an anæsthetic,
the surprisingly pleasant effect is sought for again by the one
who has had a glimpse at the portals of the elysium. This is
the beginning of the terrible habit. The effect is a sense of exhilaration
followed by a quiet, dreamy state that causes the
worried man to forget his troubles, and the sufferer his pain.
Once this freedom from physical and mental sickness has been
experienced, the cocaine fiend will rob or kill to get the drug.
Enforced non-use of it will not cure the victim. Sentence him
to a term of imprisonment, and he will go straight from the jail
door to the nearest drug store to secure cocaine before he eats
or sleeps.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>
<p>“From an occasional use of the drug to insatiable craving is
the rational course of the cocaine fiend. From thence to the
insane asylum and the grave is a swift and easy descent.</p>

<p>“In his fall from health to physical and mental disintegration,
the cocaine fiend undergoes a terrible experience. When not
in the temporary heaven that the drug provides, the victim is in
the lowest depths of an <i>inferno</i>. He suffers from insomnia,
anorexia, and gastralgic pains, dyspepsia, chronic palpitations,
and will-paresis. He is a terror both to himself and others.
The life of the man is a living death. He knows it, and with
this knowledge staring him in the face, he rushes for the drug,
and is happy for a brief period under its influence.</p>

<p>“It is time something was done to keep from this high-strung
nation a drug so deadly. Clear-minded medical men
have recommended its exclusion from the country, believing
that its use medicinally should be foregone rather than that such
a cursed temptation should be placed in the way of weak humanity.</p>

<p>“What the real action of the drug is, and how to counteract
its influence, are at present puzzling questions to the medical
fraternity. A leading member of the profession to whom these
questions were put replied after careful consideration as follows:
<a name="Page_348t" id="Page_348t"></a><a href="#Page_348tn">‘Its</a> physiological action is practically unknown. As an analgesic,
it is uniform in its action, and this is due to the suspension
of the physiological functions of the sensory cells which it
comes in contact with. Beyond this, it is an excitant of the
cerebro-spinal axis, later it has a peculiar action on the encephalon,
manifest in a wide range of psychical phenomena. Beyond
this a great variety of widely variable symptoms appear. In
some cases all the intellectual faculties are excited to the highest
degree. In others a profound lowering of the senses and
functional activities occur. Morphine-takers can use large
quantities of cocaine without any bad symptoms. Alcoholics
are also able to bear large doses. Not unfrequently the excitement
caused by cocaine goes on to convulsions, and death.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>Sometimes its action is localized to one part of the cerebro-spinal
axis, and then to another. In some cases well-marked
cerebral anæmia appears, and for a time is alarming, but soon
passes away.</p>

<p>“Small doses frequently given are more readily absorbed
than large doses. Habitues always use weak solutions, the
effects being more pleasing with less excitation. Morphine and
alcoholic inebriates very soon acquire certain tolerance to large
doses taken at once. The cocaine user takes large quantities,
but in small doses frequently repeated. He becomes frightened
at the effects of large doses, and when he cannot get the
effects from small (to him safe) doses, he resorts to alcohol,
morphine, or chloral. In many cases memories of the delusions
and hallucinations are so vivid and distressing that other narcotics
are used to prevent their recurrence. In other cases the
recollection is very confused and vague, and strong suspicions
fill the mind that the real condition is grossly exaggerated by
the friends for some deterring effect. In common with opium
and alcoholics, there is moral paralysis, untruthfulness, and low
cunning in order to conceal and explain the condition by other
than the real causes.”</p></div>

<p>Hoffman Drops are used considerably as a heart
stimulant. They are much more intoxicating than
whisky, and, used as a beverage, make the drinker
crazy while under their influence. According to
Dr. F. E. Jones, of Mass. Board of Health, they
consist of 325 parts ether, 650 parts alcohol, and 25
parts ether oil. They are said to have a very bad
effect upon the kidneys.</p>

<p><i>The Banner of Gold</i> for Oct., 1898, contained a
lengthy article upon the dangers of drugging, from
which an extract is given here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Philanthropists, when trying to stay the hand of rum, do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>not overlook the victims of drugs. If you will go, under the
protecting ægis of an officer, to an opium den, such as are to
be found in every large city, and as a visitor view for yourself
the degradation of hopeless opium users, then train your
batteries towards removal of the cause. Do not depend upon
preaching, or the writing of essays, or the delivery of an address
before some society whose mission ends in telling others what
to do, but put on the armor of earnestness, go into the nursery,
and demand of the mother to know why, when little lumps
of human clay are placed in her keeping for the sacred purpose
of moulding them into men and women, she deliberately feeds
the prattling babe with soothing syrups, sleeping drops, paregoric,
and opiates in various other forms, rather than with the
healthful food, and simple remedies, that nature only requires.
With such commercial nostrums the thoughtless mother too
often paves the way for her offspring to a life of toxic-slavery
by creating a systemic condition, which, in maturer years,
develops an abnormal craving, or appetite, for narcotics and
stimulants. Follow this little victim of nursery malpractice
through the imitative age, and you will discover in him the
cigarette smoker, the tippler, the self-abased youth, and later,
the man whose life is shadowed with the curse of baneful
appetite.</p>

<p>“Ask the druggist, and the saloon keeper, why they dispense
deadly poisons so freely to old and young, and they will tell you
the law permits it; a sad commentary!</p>

<p>“Converted men relapse into evil ways through coquetting
with sin; and cured inebriates relapse to drink, and drugs,
through the use of proprietary medicines, with which the domestic
market is flooded. Tonics, compounds, nerve remedies, bitters,
vitalizers, appetizers, balsams, pectorals and kindred nostrums
contain, with few exceptions, from 7 to 50 per cent. of alcohol,
or opium in varying quantities, each preponderating in kind,
as the effect is designed to be stimulating, or sedative. The active
principle of some of the best known catarrh remedies is co<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>caine,
and a few manufacturers are honest enough to so announce
on the labels covering their goods; more do not, and leave the
victims to discover the truth after they have paid the penalty of
ignorance, and developed the cocaine habit. Wholesale legislation,
as well as vigorous education, is needed along these lines,
and while considering means of betterment, the reputable citizen,
the clergyman, and others of good moral repute, whose
names are so generally used to herald the efficacy of so-called remedial
inventions, should not be overlooked for ethical attention.</p>

<p>“For the information of those of our readers, who are not familiar
with the nature and use of toxic drugs, we here refer
briefly to the prominent characteristics of a few most dangerously
potent for evil, and seductive in kind.</p>

<p>OPIUM AND MORPHINE:&mdash;“Gum opium, the dried milky exudate
from the green capsules of the white poppy, and its product&mdash;morphine&mdash;are
the most reliable drugs known for the relief
of pain. The dose of gum opium in medicine is from ¼ to 1
grain. It contains from 8 to 14 per cent. of morphine, which
is its principal alkaloid. Opium is a much more stable, and
stronger, sedative than morphine. The cumulative effect of
repeated medicinal doses is frequently observed, and is followed
by dangerous symptoms. It is both a sedative and hypnotic,
and, if given in large doses, quiets the brain, and excites the
spinal cord. Small doses have little perceptible effect upon the
circulation, but, under the influence of large doses, the pulse is
retarded, and the respiration becomes fuller, deeper, and slower.
In poisonous doses the pulse may become rapid, and great depression
follow, the respiratory centres are paralyzed, thus causing
death. If taken in from 2 to 4 grain doses it produces deep
comatose sleep, full breathing, full pulse, dry skin, and contracted
pupils. If the dose is sufficiently large, the sleep will be
more profound, the patient can hardly be roused, and if awakened
quickly, he sinks back into slumber. The face may be
swollen, and reddened, and the lips deeply tinged with blue. At
this stage the breathing may be characterized as puffing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>Respiration may be from 8 to 10 per minute, perhaps be reduced
to 4, 2 or 1, and as the toxic effect is more marked, it becomes
shallow, the pupils are contracted, and the patient is so
thoroughly narcotized that nothing will arouse him, the heart
ceases to beat, and he dies by respiratory failure, or paralysis of
the pneumogastric nerve.</p>

<p>“Morphine, extracted from gum opium by a slow and expensive
process, is used much less in proprietary medicines than
is tincture of opium, which is more easily manufactured.</p>

<p>“A medicinal dose of sulphate of morphine is from ⅛ to ¼ of
a grain. One grain is a dangerous dose, and 2 grains are
liable to prove fatal. Morphine is a true narcotic. It is a sedative,
lessens tissue change, and weakens every function of the
body.</p>

<p>TINCTURE OF OPIUM, OR LAUDANUM:&mdash;“Laudanum, or the
tincture of opium, is a mixture of gum opium with alcohol and
water, the solution consisting of equal parts of alcohol and
water. Each ounce contains 5½ grains of powdered gum
opium and half an ounce of alcohol, and is equal in alcoholic
strength to one ounce of strong whisky. The ordinary medical
dose is from 12 to 15 minims, or from 25 to 30 drops. It is
much used as a domestic remedy for pain from any cause, such
as ear or toothache, indigestion, insomnia, summer complaints
with children or adults, and is often used in poultices over painful
sores or swellings. It is also used in many medicines for
throat and lung troubles, in nearly all medicines for painful
chronic diseases, and in many of the well advertised spring
tonics, as well as in nearly all the compounds that are offered
for sale for blood troubles, or as alteratives. The opium in
laudanum acts the same as morphine, or any other of the thirty
preparations of opium, officially recognized by the medical
profession.</p>

<p>PAREGORIC:&mdash;“Paregoric of standard grade is half alcohol,
which is as strong of alcohol as high proof whisky. It contains
a little opium, some benzoic acid, oil of anise, and camphor. The
dose is from 15 to 60 drops.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>COCAINE:&mdash;“Cocaine is an alkaloid of coca leaves, and is used
in medicine in the form of hydro-chlorate. It is used locally in
powder or solution to relieve pain. It is a strong local anæsthetic.
The ordinary dose when used as medicine is from ¼ to
½ grain, and is very unstable and treacherous in its effects.
Some patients will tolerate large doses while in others small
doses produce unpleasant effects. Deaths are recorded from
the use of 1-7 to 1 grain.</p>

<p>CHLOROFORM:&mdash;“Chloroform is an anæsthetic, and death is
often caused by a few inhalations. The dose internally is from
3 to 20 minims. It is not much used in medicine, except to
control pain, and produce sleep. It is inhaled to produce mild
slumber, or complete insensibility in surgical operations. Death
may come suddenly, and without warning, at any time during its
administration.</p>

<p>CHLORAL:&mdash;“Chloral, or hydrate of chloral, is an hypnotic. It
is of but little value in medicine, except to control nervousness,
and produce sleep. The dose is from 15 to 30 grains. It
should be administered with caution, and only by the physician.
It is made by passing chlorine gas through pure alcohol, and
gets its name from the first syllables of the two words, chlorine
and alcohol. It produces death by inhibition of the heart’s
action, and by paralyzing the pneumogastric nerve.</p>

<p>BROMIDIA:&mdash;“Bromidia is the trademark of an hypnotic, the
manufacturers of which give out to the public that each fluid
drachm contains 15 grains of chloral hydrate, or 1 ounce to
every 4 ounces of bromidia.</p>

<p>SULPHONAL:&mdash;“Sulphonal is a coal tar preparation, and is
valuable in medicine as an hypnotic only. An ordinary dose to
produce sleep is from 10 to 40 grains. If it is given in these
doses for several days in succession it produces great weariness,
an unsteady gait, and may involve paralysis of the lower limbs,
with great disturbance of digestion, and scanty secretion of urine
of about the color of port wine. There are a number of cases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>of death reported as resulting from acute, or chronic poisoning,
by sulphonal.</p>

<p>PHENACETINE:&mdash;“Phenacetine is a product of coal tar, and an
antipyretic, a drug that lessens the temperature in high fevers,
and rapidly disintegrates the blood.</p>

<p>ANTIFEBRIN:&mdash;“Antifebrin, another of the coal tar preparations,
is the registered name for acetanelid. Its effects are very
similar to the effects of phenacetine, and it is used in fevers for
lessening the temperature, and for neuralgic pains. The medicinal
dose is from 3 to 10 grains. Unpleasant effects follow its
continued use, such as great exhaustion, blueness of the lips,
and a slow, labored pulse.</p>

<p>HEADACHE REMEDIES:&mdash;“The indiscriminate use of the
many coal tar products and other hypnotics, such as sulphonal,
phenacetine, antifebrin, chloral, bromidia, etc., under the guise
of headache remedies is productive of much disaster, all being
nerve paralyzants.”</p></div>

<p>The public owe a debt of gratitude to those
physicians, and chemists, who give freely such valuable
information as to the real nature and effects of
dangerous drugs. While it is true that the popular
belief in drugging is due to professional practice,
yet it is also true that what the people know of the
preservation of health, and of the danger of alcohol
and other drugs is largely owing to the medical profession.
There is as much difference among the
members of the medical profession as there is
among the members of any profession; some are
careless, selfish, unprincipled, unobservant of the effects
of various medicines; while others are anxious
to teach the people how to avoid sickness, and gain
strength. It is the latter class who warn against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>the self prescription of drugs, especially those of the
dangerously seductive, narcotic class.</p>

<p>Yet, with all the warnings, few pay heed. Even
highly educated, intelligent people seem possessed
of a blind faith in the power of drugs. Every little
ache or pain must have its sedative, be the future
penalty what it may.</p>

<p>Were people to quit drugging themselves, avoid
indigestible viands, eat at regular hours, chew well,
stop eating when they have had enough, take a sufficiency
of exercise, sleep and fresh air, with a hot
bath once a week, and a cold “towel bath” each
morning, laying aside all alcoholic beverages, tea
and coffee, and tobacco, there would be very little
sickness in the world. Over-eating leads to the drug
habit for relief from uneasy sensations, so does improper
food, or poorly cooked food.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that it is not possible
to violate the laws which relate to the physical well-being,
and then escape the natural penalty of
transgression by swallowing a few doses of medicine.
Remedies may postpone the results of physical
transgression, and may even seem to prevent them
altogether, but careful observation will show that
the escape from punishment is only apparent.
Sometimes a parent escapes, while his child pays
the penalty of his transgression, in a weakly nervous
system, which may lead to insanity, or other
trouble.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONIES OF PHYSICIANS AGAINST ALCOHOLIC
MEDICATION.</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p>“In abandoning the use of alcohol it should be clearly understood
that we abandon an injurious influence, and escape from
a source of disease, as we do when we get into a purer atmosphere.
<i>There is not the slightest occasion to do anything, or
to take anything to make up for the loss of a strengthening or
supporting agent.</i> No loss has been incurred save the loss of
a cause of disease and death.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. J. Ridge</span>, of London
Temperance Hospital.</p></div>

<p>Sir. B. W. Richardson, M. D., said of the London
Temperance Hospital:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“No alcohol is administered, and no substitute for it. Any
drug with similar action would be bad; warmth and suitable
nourishment are relied on to keep up the system. We know
that people who take alcohol often feel better; this is from the
narcotic action. The pain may be stilled, and the disease forgotten,
but it has not been removed; its symptom has been
narcotized.”</p></div>

<p>Another writer says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I am asked for a substitute for brandy, and frankly and
gladly I tell you there is no substitute, for I have no knowledge
of any agent equally pleasing to the palate, and yet so destructive
of life.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Norman Kerr, President of the Society for
the Study of Inebriety, England, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“My own experience of thirty-four years in the practice of
my profession has taught me that in nearly all cases and kinds of
disease the medical use of alcohol is unnecessary, and in a large
number of instances is prejudicial and even dangerous. Having
given an intoxicant, in strictly definite and guarded doses,
probably on the whole only about once in 3,000 cases (then
usually when nothing else was available in an emergency), and
having had most varieties of disease to contend with, my death-rate
and duration of illness have been quite as low as my neighbors.
The experience of the London Temperance Hospital and
other similar institutions, the current reports of that hospital
being now reliable scientific records, amply support this experience.</p>

<p>“The chief peril of narcotic drugs has always appeared to
me to lie in their disguising the real state of the patient from
himself as well as from his doctor and his friends. If there is
any serious ailment, such as cholera or fever, the sufferer may
seem to be and may feel better. He is not better. He is
actually worse&mdash;made worse by the alcohol, and not unseldom,
after the evanescent alcoholic disguise and deceptive improvement
has faded, it is found that the malady itself has been progressing,
unseen and unsuspected from the delusive aspect of
the alcohol, steadily toward a fatal termination, which might, in
many cases, have been averted but for the true state of the patient
having been completely masked.</p>

<p>“Wherever the blame really has lain, one thing is now clear,
that alcoholic intoxicants are very rarely useful as a medicine;
are at the best dangerous remedies; and that, other things being
equal, the less they are resorted to the better for the chances
of the patient’s recovery, the better for body and brain, the better
for physical, intellectual and moral well-being. Alcohol
does not nourish, but pulls down; does not stimulate, but de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>presses;
does not strengthen, but excites and exhausts. Alcohol
is the pathological fraud of frauds, degenerating while it
claims to be reconstructing, enfeebling while it appears to be
invigorating, destroying vitality while it professes to infuse new
life.”</p></div>

<p>A medical writer in the Toledo, O., <i>Blade</i> holds
up in clear light the relation of the <i>materia medica</i>
and alcohol, and the opportunity of the physician to
become a benefactor, and active temperance worker.
His remarks follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“One of the signs of the times in the temperance movement
is the steady growth among physicians of a sentiment against
the administration of liquor of any kind as a medicine. The
accepted scientific view of alcohol is that it is a poison, and its
administration should be as guarded as that of any other
poison used as a medicine. Perhaps the hardest thing a
physician finds in his effort to restore his patients to health
without the use of liquors is the common, but erroneous, belief
that they are ‘strengthening,’ and that the convalescent, by
their use, reaches recovery more quickly. The error is in supposing
that any alcoholic liquor is nourishing, or strengthening.
They are neither. Alcohol does not nourish, but it pulls
down; it does not strengthen, but excites and exhausts, for
every stimulation is necessarily followed by a period of depression,
and this is inevitably unfavorable to the patient.</p>

<p>“There is a grave responsibility resting on the physician
who prescribes alcoholic liquor. It may arouse in a susceptible
patient a dormant, inherited tendency to drink. He may,
by authorizing its use during the period of convalescence, fix a
habit upon a patient of feeble will, which the latter will never be
able to shake off. No physician who realizes this great moral
responsibility will be willing to accept it habitually. He certainly
knows that the best medical authorities agree that
alcoholic intoxicants are rarely useful as a medicine; that at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>best they are dangerous remedies, and that the less they are
resorted to, the better for both brain and body.</p>

<p>“In point of fact the physician who does his duty to his
patient teaches him the error of the prevalent belief in the
virtues of liquor in restoring the sick to health. He becomes
an active temperance worker in effect. And he can do a
noble and useful work in the rescue of those who are under
the control of the drink habit. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Furthermore, every physician owes it to his profession to
teach his patients the utter fallacy of the common belief that
alcohol is an article of food value. It has no such value.
The use of intoxicants in any quantity whatever, or at any
time, is entirely useless and unnecessary. The continued use
of them gradually induces structural degradations and functional
derangements of the great bodily organs, thus leading
to the gravest physical disorders.”</p>

<p>“I have demonstrated by actual experience that no form of
alcoholic drink is necessary, or desirable, for internal use, either
in health, or any of the varied forms of disease; but that health
can be better preserved, and disease more successfully treated,
without the use of such drinks.*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Simple truth compels
me to say that I have never yet seen a case in which the use of
alcoholic drinks either increased the force of the heart’s action,
or strengthened the patient. But I could detail very many
cases in which the administration of alcoholics was quieting the
patient’s restlessness, enfeebling the capillary circulation, and
steadily favoring increased engorgement of the lungs and other
internal viscera, and thereby hastening a fatal result, where
both attending physician and friends thought they were the
only agents that were keeping the patient alive.</p>

<p>“I have found no case of disease and no emergency arising
from accident, that I could not treat more successfully without
any form of fermented or distilled liquors than with. It is easy
to see that the anæsthetic properties of alcohol can be made
available by an intelligent and skillful physician to meet a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>limited number of indications in the treatment of some cases
that will come before him. But the same intelligence and skill
will enable him to select other remedies capable of meeting the
same indications more perfectly, and, with less tendency to
secondary bad effects. I have no hesitation, therefore, in stating
that for the attainment of the highest degree of success in
the management of all forms of disease, whether acute or
chronic, we need no form of fermented, or distilled, alcoholic
drinks. And whoever will boldly make the trial, will find that
his patients, of every kind, will make better progress, on good
air and simple nourishment, without any admixture of alcoholic
liquids, than they will with such addition. In other words he
will find that the supposed benefits of this class of agents in
medicine, are as illusory as they are in general society, and that
the words of the wise man are worthy of careful consideration
when he says: ‘Wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging,
and whosoever is <i>deceived</i> thereby is not wise.’”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. N. S.
Davis</span>, Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>“Dr. <a name="Page_360t" id="Page_360t"></a><a href="#Page_360tn">Hirschfeld</a>, a well-known physician of Magdeburg,
Germany, was recently arrested on a charge of malpractice.
The specific charge was that he had refused to give alcohol to
one of his patients who was supposed to need it. The doctor,
like the more advanced German physicians, is discarding liquor
from his practice, and made such a hot defence to the charge
that the court not only discharged the physician, but assessed
the cost of the defense against the prosecution.”&mdash;<i>Bulletin of
A. M. T. A.</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. Greene, of Boston, when addressing his brethren
and sisters of the medical association in that
city, upon alcohol, said in closing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It needs no argument to convince you that it is upon the
medical profession, to a very great extent, that the rum-seller
depends to maintain the respectability of the traffic. It requires
only your own experience, and observations, to convince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>you that it is upon the medical profession, upon their prescriptions
and recommendations for its use upon many occasions,
that the habitual dram-drinker depends for the seeming
respectability of his drinking habits. It is upon the members
of the medical profession, and the exceptional laws which it has
always demanded, that the whole liquor fraternity depends,
more than upon anything else, to screen it from <a name="Page_361t" id="Page_361t"></a><a href="#Page_361tn">opprobrium</a>,
and just punishment for the evils which the traffic entails upon
society; and it is because the rum-seller, and the rum-drinker,
hide under this cloak of seeming respectability that they are so
difficult to reach either by moral suasion, or by law. Physicians
generally have only to overcome the force of habit, and the prevailing
fashion in medicine, to find an excellent way, when they
will all look back with wonder and surprise, that they, as individuals,
and members of an honored profession, should have
been so far compromised.”</p>

<p>“It will be asked, <i>Was there no evidence of any good service
rendered by the agent in the midst of so much obvious bad
service?</i> I answer to that question <span class="smcap">that there was no
such evidence whatever, and is none</span>.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir B. W.
Richardson.</span></p>

<p>“A prominent general practitioner expressed surprise that
any one could do without alcohol in general medicine. He was
persuaded to make a trial, by abandoning the internal use of
spirits as medicine. A year afterward he wrote that his success
in the treatment of disease had been equal to that of any year
in the past, and that his cases recovered as well without alcohol
as with it. In a recent medical meeting he remarked, ‘I
thought for many years that I could not do without spirits as
medicine. I was mistaken. I am constantly treating cases of
all degrees of severity without alcohol, and my success is fully
equal to the average.’”&mdash;<i>Quarterly of A. M. T. A.</i></p>

<p>“Happily, the belief in alcohol is passing away.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. C. R.
Francis</span>, late Professor of Medicine, Calcutta Medical College.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Moor, the distinguished editor of the <i>Pacific
Record</i>, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“While the use of alcohol is always injudicious and injurious,
it is particularly so in summer, when the system is predisposed
to disturbances of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>

<p>“Alcohol flushes the capillaries of the mucous membranes
just as it does the capillaries of the skin, and where there is already
a smouldering congestion, it will take but little to light
the fire of acute inflammation, which will rage with greatly increased
intensity.</p>

<p>“It is wiser to habitually avoid even the medicinal use of alcohol,
as there are plenty of other stimulants which will give
the desired results without entailing any disastrous after effects.”</p>

<p>“All the pleasant sensations of increased mental and physical
power, which the use of alcohol produces, are deceptive and
arise from the paralysis of the judgment and the momentary

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alcohol is a functional and tissue poison, and there is no
proper or necessary use for it as a medicine.”</p>

<p>“When I first heard that there was going to be a total abstinence
hospital, I thought it would be a complete failure. That
was because I had been taught as a student to regard alcohol as
absolutely necessary in the treatment of disease. Nevertheless
I was an abstainer myself. When I was asked to join as physician,
I did not consent without a good deal of consideration, and
then only on the understanding that if I thought a person needed
it, I should be allowed to administer alcohol. I remember
the first case of severe typhoid fever I had. He was hovering
between life and death, and I was anxiously watching to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>whether it would be necessary to give alcohol, but the man
made a good recovery without it. After watching many cases
to whom I should have given alcohol if I had been treating
them elsewhere, I came to the conclusion that I had been completely
deluded. I gave it at one time to a woman in the
Hospital who was in a dying condition, but it did not save her.
I do not think I am likely to administer alcohol again. We
have had progress and efficiency in the Hospital. It has been
like an experiment for the profession, and our success shows
that this giving of alcohol is certainly a matter for re-consideration
for the medical profession. I believe that they are mistaken.
There is no doubt that the amount of alcohol used in
other hospitals has diminished greatly, compared with what
was used in the past. To the outside public also this Hospital
is an example. I believe that an immense number of the public
have been teetotalers some time in their lives, but a great many
of them have gone back to the drink in time of illness, because
they have been advised to do so. This Hospital is a
standing witness that disease and surgical injuries can
be treated without alcoholic liquors.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. J. J. Ridge</span>, of

<p>“I rarely or never prescribe alcohol as a medicament or a
food, or sanction its use as a beverage. Physiologically I look
upon alcohol as a narcotic, with perhaps a primary stimulating
effect, but I believe that such desired action as it is capable
of producing can be equally well brought about by other
agents. As a beverage the use of alcohol, particularly in excess,
is attended with definite and well-known dangers.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.

<p>“I think the medical profession could get along perfectly
well without the use of alcohol, except as it is needed in the
manufacture of drugs. As a therapeutic agent, it has very

<p>“Alcohol is used much too freely in the treatment of the

<p>“As I have said but little about the use of medicine in the
treatment of typhoid fever, save for one symptom, I may
add, for the purpose of definiteness, that I use none except
for special symptoms. The rare exceptions are stimulants
such as strychnia, in less marked indications coffee. Alcohol
as a routine drug I have entirely abandoned, having found
that the doses formerly given before or after the bath are
altogether unnecessary. Hot milk internally, or hot water
bags externally, more than replace spirits according to my
experience.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. George Dock</span>, New Orleans.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>
<p>“I have no use for alcohol, either personally, or in my practice.
Yet I cannot say that I have entirely abolished it. Alcohol
is used in compounding most of our tinctures, but in remedies
proper my experience has been that other stimulants,
such as ammonia, strychnine, caffeine, kolafra, etc., answer the
same purpose without alcohol’s dangerous effects. In my practice,
which is confined to surgery, I find very, very little use for
it. During the past year, in extreme cases, I used it in hypodermic
injections, and afterwards felt that ether, or ammonia
would have answered the same purpose. I think, in general
practice, physicians are dispensing with alcohol more and more,
but perhaps unconsciously.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">D. W. B. De Garmo</span>, Professor
of surgery in Post-Graduate Hospital, New York City.</p>

<p>“Medicine, to-day, would be in a more satisfactory condition
if the use of alcohol as a medicine had been interdicted a
hundred years ago, and the interdict had remained to the
present day. The benefits derived from its use are so small
(even when they can be proved, which is much more rarely the
case than most people imagine), and the advantages gained are
so slight, that they are completely outweighed when we set
against them the evil that has been wrought by the abuse of
alcohol, and that has arisen out of the loose methods of prescription
that have obtained, and even still obtain, in regard to
this drug.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. G. Sims Woodhead</span>, F. R. C. P., F. R. S.,
Director of the Research Laboratories of the Royal College of
Physicians and Surgeons, London.</p>

<p>“The effect of continually dosing with this drug is too
apparent wherever it is used, benumbing the senses, and rendering
more difficult every natural function. Alcohol never
sustains the powers of life. It sometimes changes the symptoms
of disease, but at the expense of the vitality of the body.
What is called its supporting action, is a fever induced by the
poison, which finally prostrates the patient. The secret of its
action is found in the laws of vitality. The man who takes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>alcohol to help digest his food, must first throw off the alcohol,
before his stomach can act healthfully.</p>

<p>“There is one encouraging fact to be noted in this connection,
that the use of alcohol in medicine has very much diminished
during the past twenty-five years, and the present
tendency is constantly in that direction. Right here is an
important point which I wish to make: When the physician
ceases to prescribe alcohol as a medicine, the drink problem
will have reached the final stage of its solution. Mankind will
eventually learn that safety lies not so much in skillful doctors,
or in some wonderful ‘new remedy,’ as in daily obedience to
the laws of health. A small amount of prevention is of more
worth than all the power of cure.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. C. H. Shepard</span>,
Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>

<p>“My observation has been that there is a decided tendency
among educated physicians to give less alcohol than formerly
in the treatment of disease. Of late years I have given but very
little alcohol in my own practice. The tendency is due, in
my opinion, to the study of the physiological action of drugs,
and to the better understanding of the causation of disease and
pathological processes. Modern investigators now know that
we have therapeutic agents that meet the requirements of
disease processes with more scientific accuracy than is obtained
by the exhibition of alcohol.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Donnelly</span>, Secretary of
Minnesota State Medical Society, St. Paul, Minn.</p>

<p>“Dr. Pearce Gould recently made a speech to the National
Temperance League on alcohol and the advantage of doing
without it, both in health and in the treatment of disease. It
takes a strong man to say the strong things which Mr. Gould
said on the subject, especially if he happens to be a medical
man. No doubt, as Dr. Gould says, the use of alcohol in
medical practice is nothing now compared to what it was
twenty years ago, much more forty years ago, when Dr.
Todd’s influence, and the reaction from the so-called antiphlogistic
treatment were at their height. Public opinion has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>enlightened by the evidence of leaders in medicine, such as Dr.
Parkes, Sir William Gull, Dr. Gairdner, Dr. Sanderson, and
others, and medical men have dared to treat disease without
alcohol, or with only small quantities of it. There are physicians
and surgeons of reputation and success, who are so
strong in their convictions that alcohol is of little use in the
treatment of disease, that it destroys tissues, lessens the
resistance to microbes, deranges functions, spoils temper, and
shortens life, that they are ready to testify to this effect in
public, in company with redoubtable champions of the temperance
cause like the Archbishop of Canterbury, Sir William
White (chief constructor of the navy), and the Bishop of
Derry, who have as much prejudice to contend against in their
spheres as the medical man has in his. We recognize with
pleasure the good done by such testimony as Dr. Gould’s.
Men whose record and authority in the profession are such as
his have the courage of their opinions, and their honest testimony
will be respected even by those who do not go quite so
far in discarding alcohol as an element of diet, or as a medicine.”&mdash;<i>The
Lancet</i>, London, May 14, 1898.</p>

<p>“The light of exact investigation has shown that the therapeutic
value of alcohol rests on an insecure basis, and it is
constantly being made clearer that after all alcohol is a sort
of poison to be handled with the same care and circumspection
as other agents capable of producing noxious and deadly
effect upon the organism. It has been shown by Abbott and
others that alcoholic animals are more susceptible to infections
than normal animals. And Laitinen, after having studied
the influence of alcohol upon infections with anthrax,
tubercle and diphtheria bacilli in dogs, rabbits, guinea-pigs
and pigeons, reaches the same general results with certainty
and directness. Under all circumstances alcohol causes a
marked increase in susceptibility no matter whether given
before or after infections, no matter whether the doses were
few and massive or numerous and small, and no matter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>whether the infection was acute or chronic. The alcoholic
animals either die while the controls remain alive, or in case
both die, death is earlier in the alcoholic. The facts brought
out by the researches of Abbott and Laitinen and others do
not furnish the slightest support for the use of alcohol in the
treatment of infectious diseases in man.”&mdash;<i>Journal American
Medical Association, Editorial, September 8, 1900.</i></p>

<p>“Step by step the progress of science has nullified every
theory on which the physician administers alcohol. Every
position taken has been disapproved. Alcohol is not a food
and does not nourish, but impairs nutrition. It is not a stimulant
in the proper acceptation of the term; on the contrary
it is a depressant. Hence its former universal use in cases
of shock was, to say the least, a grave mistake. It has been
proved by recent experiments that alcohol retards, perverts,
and is destructive either in large or small doses to normal
cell growth and development.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nathan S. Davis, Sr.</span>, M.D.,
former Dean of Northwestern University Medical School,

<p>“It seems to me that the field of usefulness of alcohol in
therapeutics is extremely limited and possibly does not exist
at all. Probably every supposed indication for its use can be
met better and more safely by other drugs. The recent work
on the so-called food value of alcohol is the subject of much
misunderstanding. While it is true that under some circumstances,
for example, after a person has acquired a certain
degree of tolerance to its poisonous effects, alcohol seems to
act as a food in the sense that fats and carbohydrates do, I
believe this to be at present a matter of little more than theoretical
importance.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Reid Hunt</span>, Chief of the Department

<p>“The physician should have blazoned before him, ‘If you
can do no good, do no harm.’ If this rule is adhered to, in
ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the physician will give
no alcohol. In the medical wards of the Pennsylvania Hospital
I have found that in acute as well as chronic disease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>we can do without alcohol. It does harm rather than good.

<p>“I very rarely use alcohol in my practice. I think that its
use is never essential. Physicians are using it less and less
in the treatment of disease owing to the recognition that it is

better when a narcotic is required.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard C. Cabot</span>,

dose and method as in the use of any other drug that in
health would prove harmful, as morphine, belladonna, aconite,
quinine, etc. I believe strongly that in pneumonia, typhoid

less place for alcoholics of any sort in my practise,
and for perhaps three years I have scarcely ever prescribed
them. I am satisfied that my cases of pneumonia
and typhoid come through in better condition without anything
alcoholic, even wines, and I no longer prescribe these
at all in cases of tuberculosis. I have noted also that among

It is a very poor agent, and only in common use

<p>“Of scarlet fever I have treated some 2,000 cases. I have
never seen a case in which, in my opinion, alcohol was necessary;
no case in which its administration was beneficial; but
I have seen more than one case in which its action was directly
injurious. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Alcohol in no case averts a fatal issue
where such is impending. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The facts are dead
against alcohol. In hospitals there has been an increase of
300 per cent. in the use of milk, and a decline of 47 per cent.
in the use of alcohol. Progress in treatment of disease has
gone hand in hand with disuse of alcohol. The use of alcohol
formerly was the outcome of ignorance, a confession of
weakness and defeat; to-day it is the expression of inability
to discard the fetters of an outworn routine.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. C. Knox

<p>“For many years I have dispensed almost entirely with alcohol
as an aid in surgical treatment. As a student I saw it
used, almost as a matter of routine, for every kind of surgical
malady except head injuries, and in my early years I naturally
followed the practise of my teachers; but as soon as
I made trial for myself of the effect of withholding alcohol,
I found how entirely overrated its value was, and how gravely
mistaken had been the teaching. It is commonly held, I believe,
that alcoholic stimulants are of especial value in all
forms of septic inflammation, such as erysipelas, pyæmia,
septicæmia, and hectic fever. I believe that this belief is
founded solely upon tradition unsupported by any trustworthy
evidence, and untested by experiment or experience.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.

<p>“I have not prescribed alcohol to my patients for more
than ten years, and can affirm positively that they have fared
well under this change of treatment. Since I formerly followed
the universal practice, I am competent to make comparisons,
and these speak unconditionally in favor of treatment
without alcohol. As a preventive of waste I use among
fever patients nothing but real foods; in addition to milk,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>particularly sugar, which can be administered to any fever
patient in ample quantity in the form of fruit juices, stewed
fruit, sweet lemonade, fruit ices, sugared tea, etc., concerning
which hundreds of investigations have demonstrated positively
that it prevents the waste of both albumen and fat.
As a stimulant I employ, besides hydriatic methods, which at
the same time abstract heat, almost nothing but camphor, and
I can affirm that it is unconditionally preferable to alcohol
for its prompt results and the absence of disagreeable after-effects
(intoxication, benumbing). Pneumonia, especially,
subsides without alcohol to perfect satisfaction, and I rejoice
to agree in this respect with Aufrecht, one of the best
authorities on this disease, who in his monograph in Nothnagle’s
manual, acknowledges himself hostile to the use of
alcohol in the treatment of pneumonia, and hopes that its
use may be speedily abolished. For the reasons previously
specified, I should like to see that extended to all use of alcohol
in therapeutics. However, that can come to pass only
when all thinking physicians clearly appreciate the fact that
no substance is able to undertake the double role of a food
and a poison, and, also, that for alcohol no nutritive, but
only toxic properties can be claimed.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Max Kassowitz</span>,

<p>“Thirty years ago the general principle of practice was
stimulation. Alcohol was supposed to rouse up and support
vital forces in disease. Twenty-three years ago the first
practical denial was put into a permanent position in a public
hospital in London, where alcohol was seldom or never
used. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Doctor Richardson’s researches showing the anæsthetic
nature of alcohol have had a great influence in
changing medical practice in England. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* On the Continent
a number of scientific workers have published researches
confirming Doctor Richardson’s conclusions, and
bringing out other facts as to the action of alcohol on the
brain and nervous system. These papers and the discussions
which followed have been slowly working their way into the
laboratory and hospital, and have been tested and found correct,
materially changing current opinions, and creating great
doubts of the value of alcohol.</p>

<p>“In 1896, the prosecution of Doctor Hirschfeld, a Magdeburg
physician, in the German courts, for not using alcohol
in a case of septicemia, seemed to be the central point for a
new demonstration of the danger of the use of alcohol in
medicine. Doctor Hirschfeld was acquitted on the testimony
of a large number of leading physicians from the large hospitals
and universities of Europe. It was proved that alcohol
was not a remedy which was specifically required in any
disease; also that its value was most seriously questioned as
a general remedy by many able men, and its substitution was
practical and literal in most cases. Statistics were presented
proving that alcohol was dangerous, and never a safe remedy,
and laboratory investigations confirming and explaining
its action were given. Since then a sharp reaction has been
going on in Europe, and alcohol is rapidly declining and
passing away as a common remedy.</p>

<p>“Doctor Frick, an eminent teacher of medicine in Zurich,
Switzerland, and Doctor von Speyer, of the University of
Berne, have made statistical studies of cases treated with

assert very positively, that alcohol is a dangerous and exceedingly
doubtful remedy. Doctor Meyer, of the University
of Gottenburg, Doctor Möbius, of Leipsic, and Doctor
Wehberg, of Dusseldorf, are equally prominent physicians
who have taken the same position, and are equally emphatic

<p>Dr. H. D. Didama, Dean of the Medical College
of Syracuse University, Syracuse, N. Y., said in
January, 1898, in the <i>Voice</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“For many years after my graduation at Albany, in 1846,
I prescribed alcohol, and for twenty years, while occupying the
chair of professor of the science and art of medicine in the
College of Medicine of Syracuse University. I followed in my
lectures&mdash;often reluctantly and usually afar off, but still I
followed&mdash;the almost unanimous teaching of authors, ancient
and modern, and the professors in the medical schools.</p>

<p>“Convinced that a great number of the diseases I was called
to treat owed their existence or aggravation to the use, in
alleged moderation, of alcoholic beverages, and that not in a
few instances this use was commenced and even continued by
the advice of the medical attendants; convinced also by the
published experiments of many acute observers at home and
abroad, and by my own observations, that almost all diseases
could be managed as well if not better by the non-use of
alcohol, and satisfied from the communications of some
brother practitioners that the fatality in certain specified diseases
was not delayed, to say the least, by the employment of
increasing and enormous doses of wine, whisky and brandy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>and influenced also, I must admit&mdash;overwhelmed, indeed&mdash;by
what I know and what I read daily of the pauperism, domestic
wretchedness, crime, insanity and incurable maladies transmitted
to innocent offspring, I abandoned entirely, more than
three years ago, the use of alcoholic remedies.</p>

<p>“I have endeavored by personal example and earnest council
to dissuade my patients from the use of intoxicating beverages
and medicines.</p>

<p>“The outcome of this practice, medically and morally, has
been satisfactory to myself, and, I have reason to believe, to
my patients also.</p>

<p>“Whatever regrets I may feel for my former teaching and
practice, I have no apology to offer for my inconsistency except
that once given by Gerrit Smith:&mdash;‘I know more to-day
than I did yesterday; the only persons who never change
their minds are God and a fool.’</p>

<p>“Permit me to add that while there may be an honest difference
of opinion regarding the efficacy of legislative enactments
in overcoming or restraining the drink habit, there should be
little doubt that a whole-hearted, persistent, precept-and-example
effort of the medical profession exerted as individuals on
their patients and the families of their patients, and as associations
on the community at large, would do immeasurable good.</p>

<p>“And the newspapers might aid materially in this beneficent
work if, while they continue to spread before our households
every day the details of the brawls and fights of drunken men
and the horrible murders which they commit, they would discontinue
advertising, without warning or dissent, side by side
with the atrocities, the ‘innocuous beers,’ the pure malt whiskies,
the genuine brandies, guaranteed to prevent and cure all
manner of diseases.”</p></div>

<p>The following testimony from an English physician
is significant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Although I know beforehand that their united testimony
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>must be in favor of the practice of total abstinence from all
intoxicating drinks, being most conducive to health and longevity
of their patients, but very inimical to the pocket interests
of themselves, my own experience is, that my teetotal patients
are seldom ill, and that they get well very soon again, if they
are attacked by disease. A higher principle than that of gain
must influence a medical man’s mind, or he will never advocate
the doctrine of total abstinence.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. J. Ritchie</span>, M. R. C. S.,
Leek.</p>

<p>“One of the most dangerous phases of the use of alcohol is
the production of a feeling of well being in weakly, dyspeptic,
irritable, nervous or anæmic patients. In consequence of the
temporary relief so obtained, the patient develops a craving
for alcohol, which in many cases can end only in one way,
and, as I felt compelled to tell an assembly of ladies a short
time ago, the very symptoms for the alleviation of which
alcohol is usually taken are those, the presence of which
renders it exceedingly desirable that alcohol should not be
taken.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. G. Sims Woodhead</span>, of London.</p></div>

<p>In an address upon the London Temperance
Hospital delivered shortly before his death, Sir B.
W. Richardson gave a brief review of the influences
which led him to abandon the medical use of alcohol.
The following is taken from that address as
reported in the <i>Medical Pioneer</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I was a member of the Vestry of St. Marylebone, and we
had in our parish a very serious outbreak of small-pox, attended
with a considerable mortality. In his report to us Dr.
Whitmore stated that in his treatment of earlier cases of the
confluent and hemorrhagic, and malignant forms of disease,
stimulants of wine and brandy were freely administered without
any apparent benefit; and, that after consultation with Mr.
Cross, the resident surgeon, they resolved to substitute simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>nutriments, such as milk, eggs and beef-tea, at frequent intervals,
with discontinuance of stimulants altogether. The result
of the change was most satisfactory, and many bad cases did
well, which under the stimulant plan they believed would have
terminated fatally. Again I was struck very much by a report
made by Mr. Cadbury, in which that gentleman showed the
course that was going on in various hospitals. The amount of
alcohol in twelve hospitals in London, taken by the inpatients,
varied in ounces from 37,531 in one establishment to 300,094 in
another during the year 1878. I also found, from the same
author, that the whole cost in St. George’s Union Infirmary for
the year 1878 was £8. 3s. 6d., amongst 2,496 patients, while the
cost of the same number at the average of the twelve hospitals
was £124. About this same time I also remarked that in many
of the public institutions of England there was a reduction
something similar in kind, if not to the same extent, and that
the number of persons who suffered seemed to make better recoveries
than those who were taking the free amount of stimulant.
The effect of these observations chimed in very remarkably
with the physiological experiments it had been my duty to
carry out, and which tended to show in a most striking manner
that the action of alcohol in the body very much differed from
the ordinary opinion that had been held upon it, and thereupon,
in my own practice, I abandoned the use of alcohol, and began
to give instead small quantities of simple, nourishing, dietic
food, a course I pursued up to the present time with the most
satisfactory results, results I have never felt any occasion to regret.
By these steps, learned in the first place from the study
of alcohol in its action on man, I was led to become a believer
that alcohol is of no more service in disease than it is in health,
and a lengthened experience in this matter has really confirmed
the correctness of the idea.”</p></div>

<p>In his last report as physician to the Temperance
Hospital Dr. Richardson made some remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>statements upon the fallacy of the general ideas of
stimulation. So interesting are his views that they
are incorporated here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Sir B. W. Richardson, M. D., who was unable to be present,
communicated (through the secretary) his annual report as
physician to the hospital. After twelve months further trial of
the treatment of all kinds of disease in this institution without
the assistance of alcohol, either as a diet or a medicine, he (Sir
B. W. Richardson) was fully sustained in the belief that the
plan pursued had been attended with every possible advantage.
About 500 cases had come under his observation and treatment
as in previous years, and these cases had been of the most
varied kind, including all patients who were not directly suffering
from contagious disease. In not one instance had alcohol
been administered, nor had anything like it been used in the
way of a substitute, and there had not been a single case in
which he could conceive that it was ever called for, while the
success which had attended the treatment generally had been
superior to anything he had ever seen following upon the
administration of alcoholic stimulants. One great truth
which had forced itself upon him had reference to the doctrine
of stimulation generally. It had been one of the grand
ideas in medicine that there came times when sick people
were benefited by being stimulated. It was argued that
they were low, and in order that they might be raised and
brought nearer to the natural life they required something like
alcohol to quicken the circulation, quicken the secretion, and
help to preserve the vitality. But the experience which was
learned here tended to show in the most distinct manner that
that very old and apparently rational idea was fallacious. Such
stimulation only tended ultimately to wear out the powers of the
body, as well as change the physical conditions under which the
body worked. True lowness meant practical over-fatigue, and
when the body was spurred on, or stimulated, over-fatigue was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>simply intensified and increased. What, therefore, was wanted
was not stimulation, but repose. The sufferer was placed in
the best position to gain entire rest, and all the surroundings or
environments were employed which tended to prevent waste.
The air was kept at the proper temperature, the body of the
patient kept warm, and the simplest and most easily digested
foods were used; the patient’s condition then swung round to
a natural state, and he began to get well. In other cases where
the sick were brought under observation suffering already from
excitable condition of the senses, with congestions here and there
of the circulatory or nervous systems, with imperfect condition
of the brain, and with the elements of what was usually denominated
inflammatory or febrile state&mdash;the stimulant was already
present (was, indeed the cause of the symptoms) and did
not want in any degree to be enforced further by the acts of
treatment. Here, therefore, they were on the safest grounds as
regarded methods of administration, for they calmed as well as
they possibly could both mind and body and left nature to do
the rest, which she did with the best and most tranquilizing effect.
On both sides, therefore, in the treatment of disease, they
did good, and that was the reason, he believed, why their returns
were so satisfactory. It often happened in an institution
where some particular plan was carried out that the old ideas
in which they had been bred were without intention refined or
suppressed. For example, he had been taught, and believed for
a number of years, that some medicament of a particular kind
was needful for some particular train of symptoms, be the surrounding
conditions what they might. There was no doubt
that this same feeling had given rise to the persistent use of
alcohol; but, greatly to his own surprise, he discovered that
when the surroundings were all good, the rule that applied to
alcohol constantly applied to other substances that were called
remedies, with the result that recovery was often just as good
without the particular remedies as with them, so that a revision
came quite simply with regard to stimulating agents and their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>properties, and also with regard to every medicine that might
at earlier times have been employed. He had seen many cases
in this hospital recover without any other aid than that of the
environments, which cases he would have said could not possibly
have gone on well, or towards complete recovery, unless
some special recipe had been followed. He believed the day
would come when others, learning this same truth as he had been
obliged to learn it, would act on such simple principles that the
books of remedies would have to be vastly curtailed. It would
be seen that there was such a tendency of disease to get well
of itself, or by virtue of natural processes, of which people had
at present but a very poor idea, that the art of physic would
pass into directions how to live rather than into dogmatic assertions
that particular means must be employed in addition to the
common details of life for the process of cure. If therefore
they learned in this hospital by their reduced death-rates the
true lesson, the institution would have performed a double duty,
and become one of the test objects in medicine, and in the field
of disease. They made no attempt by selection, or by any side
action, to exaggerate their results. The cases were taken indiscriminately,
except that they gave admission to the worst
cases first; that was to say, they never caused patients to come
under their treatment if they saw they were only slightly affected,
and were bound to get well.”&mdash;<i>Medical Pioneer.</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. Landmann, of Boppard-on-the-Rhine, Germany,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The members of the Association of Abstaining Physicians,
reject the use of spirituous liquors in every form, and particularly
declare the use of alcohol at the sick-bed a scientific error
of the saddest kind. In order to war against this abuse, they
earnestly appeal to the officers having charge of funds for the
sick, henceforth, under no circumstances, any longer to permit
the prescription of wine, whisky and brandy for sick members;
but to resist to the utmost, according to the right given them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>by the laws insuring the sick, the taking of spirituous liquors,
under the false pretext that they have a curative and strengthening
effect.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Bleuler, Rheineau, Switzerland, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The treatment of chronic diseases with alcohol is contrary
to our knowledge of the physiological effects of alcohol. There
is no probability that its use will be beneficial, certainly its benefits
have not been established. Often an injurious result is
proved.</p>

<p>“It is not implied that there may not be some benefit in the
use of alcohol in cases of sudden weakness with or without
fever. But even in such cases the benefit is not demonstrated.
At any rate, other remedies can with advantage be substituted
for alcohol.</p>

<p>“The essential thing in the treatment of all alcoholic diseases,
delirium tremens included, is total abstinence.</p>

<p>“The physiological effect of alcohol is that of a poison, whose
use is to be limited to the utmost. Even the moderate use as
now practiced is injurious.</p>

<p>“The customary beneficial results unquestionably depend
chiefly on suggestion, and by making the patient believe falsely
that the momentary subjective better feeling means actual improvement.</p>

<p>“Physicians share the blame of the present flood of alcoholism.
They are, therefore, morally bound to remedy the evil.
Only by means of personal abstinence can this be done.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. A. Frick, professor in Zurich, is a careful
student and an influential writer on alcohol. His
statements are weighty. This is his testimony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In larger doses, alcohol is absolutely injurious in the treatment
of acute fevers, especially in case of pneumonia, typhus
and erysipelas. They first of all injure the general state
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>of the patient, they cause delirium, or increase it if already existing,
and, secondly, they injure most seriously the organs of
digestion and interfere with proper nourishment; thus they have
a weakening effect, instead of preventing weakness, which they
are usually supposed to do. In case no alcohol is used, the
convalescence is much more rapid. In no case has the benefit
of treatment with alcohol been established. According to the
view of the most eminent pharmacologists, the stimulating
effect of alcohol consists simply in a local irritation of the mucous
membrane of the stomach, similar to that produced by a
mustard plaster.”</p></div>

<p>The following selection from the excellent address
of Dr. Harvey, president of the Virginia State Medical
Society, at a recent meeting, is a most timely
caution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Our prisons, asylums and homes are filled with the victims
of the careless and indiscriminate use by the medical profession
of those twin demons, alcohol and opium, which, save tuberculosis,
are doing more to debase and destroy the human race
than all the other diseases together. I most earnestly beseech
you, young men, who are just starting out in life, to stay your
hand in the use of these agents in your own persons, and in
your daily work, and to beware of the seductive needle, and the
cup that inebriates. Make it an invariable rule, never to prescribe
alcohol, nor one of the solinaceus or narcotic drugs, if
you can possibly avoid it. The use of alcohol and opium debases
the minds and morals of habitués, predisposes especially
to Bright’s disease and insanity, and lays the foundation in the
offspring for the majority of the neuroses and degenerations of
modern civilized life. The physical fatigue of long working
hours, loss of sleep, mental strain, worry and hunger, invite the
tired physician, especially, to their seductive use. To totally
abstain from them is always business, and very often character,
and even life itself. I feel free to speak to you on this subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>very earnestly, my younger brothers, for, having prescribed
alcohol for over thirty years, I am familiar with its tendencies
and its dangers.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. T. D. Crothers of Hartford, Conn., in an article
upon “The Decline of Alcohol as a Medicine,”
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Thoughtful observers recognize that alcohol as a medicine
is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. Ten years ago leading
medical men and text-books spoke of stimulants as essentials
of many diseases, and defended their use with warmth and
positiveness. To-day this is changed. Medical men seldom
refer to spirits as remedies, and when they do, express great
conservatism and caution. The text-books show the same
changes, although some dogmatic authors refuse to recognize
the change of practice, and still cling to the idea of the food
value of spirits.</p>

<p>“Druggists who supply spirits to the profession recognize a
tremendous dropping off in the demand. A distiller who, ten
years ago, sold many thousand gallons of choice whiskies, almost
exclusively to medical men, has lost his trade altogether,
and gone out of business. Wine men, too, recognize this
change, and are making every effort to have wine used in the
place of spirits in the sick-room. Proprietary medicine dealers
are putting all sorts of compounds of wine with iron, bark, etc.,
on the market with the same idea. It is doubtful if any of these
will be able to secure any permanent place in therapeutics.</p>

<p>“The fact is, alcohol is passing out of practical therapeutics
because its real action is becoming known. Facts are accumulating
in the laboratory, in the autopsy room, at the bedside,
and in the work of experimental psychologists, which show that
alcohol is a depressant and a narcotic; that it cannot build up
tissue, but always acts as a degenerative power; and that its
apparent effects of raising the heart’s action and quickening
functional activities are misleading and erroneous.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>
<p>“French and German specialists have denounced spirits both
as a beverage and a medicine, and shown by actual demonstration
that alcohol is a poison and a depressant, and that any
therapeutic action it is assumed to have is open to question.</p>

<p>“All this is not the result of agitation and wild condemnation
by persons who feel deeply the sad consequences of the abuse
of spirits. It is simply the outcome of the gradual accumulation
of facts that have been proven within the observation of
every thoughtful person. The exact or approximate facts relating
to alcohol can now be tested by instruments of precision.
We can weigh and measure the effects, and it is not essential
to theorize or speculate; we can test and prove with reasonable
certainty what was before a matter of doubt.</p>

<p>“Medical men who doubt the value of spirits are no more
considered fanatics or extremists, but as leaders along new and
wider lines of research. Alcohol in medicine, except as a narcotic
and anæsthetic, is rapidly falling into disfavor, and will
soon be put aside and forgotten.”</p></div>

<h3>RECENT RESEARCHES UPON <a name="Page_392t" id="Page_392t"></a><a href="#Page_392tn">ALCOHOL</a>.</h3>


<p>In the year 1900 Prof. Taav Laitinen, of the University
of Helsingfors, Finland, published an account
of experiments made upon 342 animals&mdash;dogs, rabbits,
guinea pigs, fowls and pigeons&mdash;to determine the
effects of alcohol upon the resistance of the body to
infectious diseases. He used as infecting agents,
anthrax bacilli, tubercle bacilli, and diphtheria bacilli.
The doses of alcohol given varied with the animal.
For his “small dose” experiments he used the quantity
of alcohol given as a food or as a medicine, or
both, in a neighboring sanitorium. The alcohol employed
was, as a rule, a 25 per cent. solution of ethyl
alcohol in water. It was given either by esophageal
catheter, or by dropping it into the mouth from a
pipette. It was administered in several ways, and for
varying times; sometimes in single large doses, at
others in gradually increasing doses for months at a
time, in order to produce here an acute, and there a
chronic poisoning; in fact, he produced the conditions
consequent upon steady, moderate drinking.</p>

<p>His first conclusion from these experiments, most
carefully carried out, is that alcohol, however given,
induces in the animal body a markedly increased susceptibility
to infectious diseases; and he maintains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>that his experiments indicate that the use of alcohol,
at least in the treatment of anthrax, tuberculosis, and
diphtheria, is not only useless but probably injurious.
From a number of other experiments carried out with
scrupulous care he comes to the same conclusion as
Abbott, Welch, and others that the predisposing to
disease of alcohol must be explained by its action in
producing abnormal conditions&mdash;pathological changes
in the alimentary canal, liver, kidneys, heart, and nervous
system. He found that the alkalinity of the blood
was slightly diminished, and the number of leucocytes
somewhat decreased. He also draws attention to the
fact that his experiments prove that pregnant animals
and their offspring are markedly affected by the continued
use of small doses of alcohol. He shows, too,
that the temporary lowering of the body temperature
by alcohol produces the most favorable condition for
the invasion of disease germs.</p>

<p>Since the publication of these experiments, and of
others similar to them, the use of alcohol in diphtheria
and tuberculosis has very largely ceased. Boards of
health and charity organizations unite in warning
against indulgence in alcoholic drinks as conducive to
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>At the International Congress on Alcoholism, held
in London in July, 1909, Professor Laitinen delivered
two lectures. The first was upon “The Influence of
Alcohol on Immunity.” The following is taken from
this lecture:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Modern researches have done much to explain the extent
and nature of the protective powers by which the or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>ganism
endeavors to defend itself against the attacks of all
kinds of injurious agencies, and especially against invasion
by the germs of infective diseases. It is now a well-established
fact that alcohol weakens the normal resisting power
of the body against the above-named disease-producing influences.
In the hope of contributing something to the explanation
of the way in which alcohol weakens the organism,
I have made a number of experiments bearing upon the question
of the influence of alcohol on immunity.</p>

<p>“Early in this century careful experiments went to show
that alcohol certainly had some influence upon immunity.
Two Americans, Abbott and Bergey, were the first to discover
that this agent produces a diminution of the hæmolytic
complement in the blood-serum of certain animals which
were tested. They showed also that the formation of specific
hæmolytic receptors (immune bodies) may be retarded
by the action of alcohol.</p>

<p>“The extent of the evil effects upon the human body resulting
from the consumption of alcoholic liquors is as yet
far from being fully known, and stands in need of scientific
verification. Many other injurious influences such as
unsanitary dwellings, bad feeding, excessive toil, and toxic
agents like nicotine, etc., may produce somewhat similar morbid
effects. It is therefore necessary, in the scientific study
of the question, to take these possibilities into consideration.
In my investigations, the results of which I am now to lay
before you, I have endeavored to select as subjects for my
experiments both abstainers from alcohol, and those who
indulge more or less in its use, in such a way that their
conditions of life and their habits in other respects should
be as nearly as possible the same. All persons, for instance,
suffering from any acute or chronic disease were rejected,
and very few of the persons selected were smokers. The
subject of this research has been human blood, and especially
its two principal components, namely, red blood-corpuscles
and blood-serum, both of which up to the present
time have been very little studied in relation to the ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>tion
under discussion. I have gone into these matters chiefly
because the modern theoretical study of immunity during the
last few years has, in general, attracted greater attention to
the blood, and shown the important role which the different
parts, properties, and capacities of the blood play in defending
the organism against internal and external injurious
agencies. Further, the subtle methods employed in the study
of immunity (such as organic reactions, and reactions between
greatly attenuated organic liquids) would also seem to be
available for our purpose, as they allow of the detection of
the minutest differences which alcohol may produce in any
part of the organism in question.</p>

<p>“During the course of this research, which has lasted over
a period of three years, I sought to investigate the action of
alcohol on the resistive power of human red blood-corpuscles.
I wished to ascertain whether the resistivity of the
red blood-corpuscles in a healthy man could be lowered by
the consumption of alcohol. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“It may be well for me here to explain that in this lecture
I mean by the term ‘drinker’ a person who has taken
alcohol in any quantity whatever. Many of these ‘drinkers,’
therefore, were in fact most moderate consumers of alcohol.
By the term ‘abstainer’ I mean a person who has never taken
alcohol in any quantity worth mentioning. In the course of
my investigations I have examined blood from two hundred
and twenty-three persons. They were of different classes
and ages. There were professors of medicine and other
physicians, University fellows, students of both sexes, hospital
nurses, school-teachers, waiters, and other men and
women belonging to the working-classes.”</p></div>

<p>The rest of the lecture as given here is an abstract
made by Professor Laitinen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“My studies have been directed to an investigation of the
following points:</p>

<p>“1. I sought to ascertain whether the resistance of human
red blood-corpuscles against a heterogeneous normal serum,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>or an immune serum, can be diminished by the use of alcohol.</p>

<p>“2. I have studied the action of alcohol in drinking and
abstaining persons on the hæmolytic power of blood-serum
over heterogeneous red blood-corpuscles (rabbits). I have
studied not only the hæmolytic power of the human blood-serum,
but also its power of precipitation in the presence of
rabbit-serum, with a view to ascertain if the reaction between
a known dilution of rabbit-serum and a certain dilution
of serum of alcohol-users and non-drinking persons is
different or not, and if the reaction is more apparent with
the former or with the latter.</p>

<p>“3. The resisting power of serum obtained both from alcohol-drinking
and from non-drinking persons was further
tested by human blood, with the object of discovering whether
any difference in reaction existed between the same immune
serum and the two kinds of human sera above mentioned.</p>

<p>“4. I have studied the problem as to whether the hæmolytic
complement in the blood-serum of alcohol-drinking and non-drinking
persons is altered in any way by alcohol.</p>

<p>“5. The bactericidal power of blood-serum from both alcohol-drinking
and non-drinking persons was determined by
some experiments.</p>

<p>“The above experiments have given the following results:</p>

<p>“1. The normal resistance of human red blood-corpuscles
appears to be somewhat diminished against a heterogeneous
normal serum or an immune serum by the consumption of
alcohol, provided that tolerably large equal, or nearly equal,
numbers of drinkers and abstainers of both sexes be examined,
and the average of resistance be taken on both sides:
this last-named precaution being necessary because the resistance
of red blood-corpuscles from different human beings
varies largely. The difference is often greater when using
weaker solutions than when using stronger dilutions of
lysin.</p>

<p>“2. These experiments have shown the normal hæmolytic
power of human blood-serum to be less in the case of alco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>hol-drinkers
than in that of abstainers.</p>

<p>“3. The precipitating reaction between a solution of 1 per
cent. human blood-serum and different dilutions of immune
serum was greater in the case of drinkers than in that of
abstainers.</p>

<p>“4. These experiments have also shown that the bactericidal
power of blood-serum against typhoid bacteria was less
in the case of drinkers than in that of abstainers.</p>

<p>“It seems clear, therefore, that alcohol, even in comparatively
small doses, exercises a prejudicial effect on the protective
mechanism of the human body.”</p></div>

<p>The lecturer made his points clear by a carefully
prepared series of charts. At its close Sir Victor
Horsley, Professor Sims Woodhead, A. Pearce Gould,
and several other distinguished physicians spoke in
high terms of the painstaking care exhibited in the
experiments.</p>

<p>Professor Laitinen’s second lecture was upon “The
Influence of Alcohol Upon Human Offspring.” He
sent out 15,000 circulars to his countrymen, asking
many questions relative to themselves and their infant
children, and received 5,845 replies relative to 20,008
children. He also studied personally a large number
of drinking and abstaining families. From these studies
he shows by careful tables that the drinking of
alcohol by parents, even in small quantities, has an
injurious influence upon human offspring. His studies
in former years showed the same unfavorable
influence upon the offspring of animals. One of his
tables gives percentages of deaths of children in the
homes of abstaining parents, moderate drinkers, and
harder drinkers. Children of abstainers dying in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>first year, 13.45 per cent.; of moderates, 23.17 per
cent.; of harder drinkers, 32.02 per cent. Other tables
show that abstainers’ children gain in weight more
steadily in the first year than drinkers’ children, and
have their teeth earlier, as a rule.</p>

<p>At the International Medical Congress of 1909, held
in Budapest, Professor Laitinen lectured again upon
his researches, and summarized his conclusions thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“1. The importance of alcohol as an article of food is rendered
very questionable by recent researches. 2. These researches
prove that alcohol diminishes the natural power of
the tissues to resist injury, promotes degeneration, and has a
disastrous effect on future generations. 3. The questions of
relation of alcoholic liquor to crime and of the manufacture
and sale of such beverages deserve the serious consideration
of the legislature. 4. It is the duty of medical men to direct
more attention than formerly to the alcohol question, and by
careful study to decide whether recent researches are justified
or not in regarding alcohol and alcoholic beverages as
a poison and one of the principal causes of degeneration in
the human family; they ought also to consider whether it
would not be advisable in medical practice, and especially in
hospitals, either to banish it altogether or at least to prescribe
it with the same care as other poisonous drugs. In
this matter the attitude taken by medical men as representatives
of public hygiene was of quite exceptional importance.”</p></div>

<p>Metchnikoff, the illustrious Russian scientist, who
has for some years been connected with the Pasteur
Institute in Paris, was the discoverer of the work
assigned by nature to the white corpuscles of the
blood. These blood-cells are the “guardian-cells” of
the body, and their duty is to destroy disease germs
which may gain an entrance. They actually devour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>disease germs. Metchnikoff has been studying the
effect of alcohol upon these protective cells, and he
asserts that alcohol, even in small doses, has a harmful
action on these agents of defence against disease.
Alcohol seems to paralyze them more or less so that
they are unable to do their full duty in destroying the
infective microbes. Thus disease germs can multiply
more rapidly when alcohol is in the blood. In his
book called “The New Hygiene,” Metchnikoff suggests
that the administration of alcoholic liquors in
infectious disease appears to be attended with danger
to the patient.</p>

<p>The researches of Kraepelin, Ach, Aschaffenberg
and other German scientists have become so well
known through the articles by Henry Smith Williams
in <i>McClure’s Magazine</i> that only brief reference need
be made to them here. Kraepelin used very small
doses of alcohol for some of his experiments. He
found that after ¼ to ½ ounce of alcohol had been
taken the time occupied in making response to a signal
was slightly shortened, but in a few minutes, in
most cases, this quickening action passed and a slowing
process began, and continued until the body was
free from the influence of the alcohol, which was
sometimes four or five hours.</p>

<p>The ability to add figures was tested, and this decreased
very rapidly under minute doses of alcohol.
Memory tests showed that only 60 figures could be
remembered from numbers written in columns after
alcohol had been taken, while 100 figures could be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>remembered correctly when the mind was free from
the alcoholic influence. Type-setters were tested, and
the average number of errors they made and the
amount of work they did in a given time was carefully
recorded. After a small dose of alcohol none
of the men could in the same time do as much work,
or as accurate work. Yet every one of the men experimented
upon thought he was doing better work after
his drink. This proves the narcotic effect of alcohol.</p>

<p>The economic loss to a people from beer and wine
drinking is worthy of serious consideration since a
bottle of wine or its equivalent in beer could diminish
by ten to fifteen per cent. the amount of work done
by these type-setters experimented upon by Professor
Aschaffenberg.</p>

<p>Professor Kraepelin says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“I must admit that my experiments, extending over more
than ten years, have made me an opponent of alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>He says again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The laborer who wins his livelihood by the working power
of his arm strikes at the very foundation of his power by
the use of alcohol.”</p></div>

<p>Professor Aschaffenberg says of moderate doses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Any quantity of alcohol must be regarded as considerable
which causes a disturbance, even if only transitory, of
bodily and mental efficiency.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Reid Hunt, chief of the Division of Pharmacology,
Hygienic Laboratory, United States Public
Health and Marine Hospital Service, made some very
interesting experiments to determine the physiological
changes upon animals which would result from the
strictly moderate use of alcohol. These are described
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>in Bulletin No. 33 of the Hygienic Laboratory, published
in 1907. Mice and guinea-pigs were used. The
food, usually oats, was soaked in diluted alcohol, at
first of five per cent. strength, then gradually increased
to forty or fifty per cent. By carefully observing the
weight of the mice, and not increasing the strength
of the alcohol too rapidly, it was possible to keep the
animals for months on this diet without any material
loss of weight. After the lapse of weeks, in some
cases, and months in other cases, these alcohol fed animals
were given small doses of a poison known as
acetonitrile. Other mice to whom no alcohol was fed
were given similar doses of this poison. In the first
series the mice which had received alcohol died from
about one-half the quantity of acetonitrile required to
kill those which had not received alcohol. In the second
series with a somewhat stronger dilution the alcohol
mice succumbed to one-half to one-third the dose
necessary to kill the non-alcoholized animals. In no
case was enough alcohol given for any symptoms of
intoxication to appear, nor was there any outward
indication of any injury being done by the alcohol. In
another experiment a mouse was kept for four months
on a diet of oats soaked in water, then 0.5 milligram
of acetonitrile per gram body weight was injected.
The mouse recovered. It was then fed on oats soaked
in an alcoholic solution which was gradually increased
to 45 per cent. After a little more than a month of
this diet 0.2 milligram acetonitrile per gram body
weight proved fatal. The weight of the mouse had
remained about the same throughout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>Alcohol increased the susceptibility of the guinea
pigs also.</p>

<p>Dr. Hunt says on page 33 of the bulletin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These experiments with alcohol and acetonitrile are of
interest in another connection. The greatest advance in recent
years in our knowledge of the physiological action of
alcohol has been the clear demonstration that alcohol is oxidized
in the body, and may replace fats and carbohydrates
and to a certain extent, the proteids of an ordinary diet.
So clear has been this demonstration that the view that alcohol,
in moderate amounts, should be regarded as a food is
almost universally accepted by physiologists, and the drift of
opinion is certainly toward the view that it is in all respects
strictly <a name="Page_402t" id="Page_402t"></a><a href="#Page_402tn">analogous</a> to sugar and fats, provided always
that the amount used does not exceed that easily oxidized
by the body. Under these premises it would be expected that
alcohol in a diet would have the same effect upon an animal’s
susceptibility to acetonitrile as has dextrose, for example.
This is by no means the case, however; on the contrary,
the action of these substances in this regard is entirely
different. Mice fed upon oats soaked in a solution of
dextrose or upon cakes containing considerable dextrose, or
upon rice, show a very distinct increase in their resistance to
acetonitrile; such mice may recover from two or three times
the dose fatal to controls. (Controls are the animals fed in
the ordinary way without alcohol or in this case dextrose.&mdash;Ed.)
While these facts are not sufficient to justify the conclusion
that in many cases alcohol has not a true food value,
yet they are sufficient to indicate caution in applying, without
further consideration, the brilliant and very exact results
on the proteid sparing power of alcohol to practical
dietaries.”</p></div>

<p>Various other experiments were made, but there is
not room here for a record of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>In the summary Dr. Hunt says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is believed that these experiments afford clear experimental
evidence for the view that extremely moderate
amounts of alcohol may cause distinct changes in certain
physiological functions, and that these changes may, under
certain circumstances, be injurious to the body. The results
also afford further evidence that in some respects the action
of alcohol as a food is different from that of carbohydrates,
and finally that in all probability certain physiological processes
in ‘moderate drinkers’ are distinctly different from
those in abstainers.”</p></div>

<p>Professor Chittenden, of Yale University, has made
extensive researches upon alcohol and digestion. A
full report of these may be found in the “Physiological
Aspects of the Liquor Problem.” In the <i>Medical
News</i>, vol. 86, page 721, Professor Chittenden says
of the theory that alcohol is a food similar to sugar and
fats:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is, I think, quite plain that while alcohol in moderate
amounts can be burned in the body, thus serving as food in
the sense that it may be a source of energy, it is quite misleading
to attempt a classification or even comparison of
alcohol with carbohydrates and fats, since, unlike the latter,
alcohol has a most disturbing effect upon the metabolism or
oxidation of the purin compounds of our daily food. Alcohol,
therefore, presents a dangerous side wholly wanting in
carbohydrates and fats. The latter are simply burned up to
carbonic acid and water, or are transformed into glycogen
and fat, but alcohol, though more easily oxidizable, is at all
times liable to obstruct, in some measure at least, the oxidative
processes of the liver, and probably of other tissues
also, thereby throwing into the circulation bodies such as
uric acid, which are inimical to health; a fact which at once
tends to draw a distinct line of demarcation between alcohol
and the two non-nitrogeneous foods&mdash;fat and carbohydrate.”</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. S. P. Beebe, now of the Cornell Medical College
Laboratory, New York City, has made some very
valuable experiments with alcohol. It is well known
that impairment of the functions of certain organs results
in the appearance in the urine of nitrogeneous
compounds which do not normally occur there. In
certain diseases of the liver the same quantity of
nitrogen may be excreted as in health, but a portion
of it is in the form of acids never found in the urine
during health. Dr. Beebe, with this knowledge in
mind, sought to discover the effects of alcohol upon
the excretion of uric acid in man. Most of the experiments
were made on the same person, a young man in
good health, of regular habits, unaccustomed to the
use of alcohol in any form. Absolute alcohol, diluted
with water, whisky, ale, and port wine were used
at different times. Dr. Beebe reported his experiments
in the <i>American Journal of Physiology</i>, vol. 12, No. 1.
His conclusions are given as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“After a consideration of these experiments, it hardly
seems possible to doubt that alcohol, even in what is considered
by the most conservative as a moderate amount,
causes an increase in the excretion of uric acid, and this
effect is seen almost immediately after taking the alcohol.
The following points indicate that the effect is due to a
toxic effect on the liver, thereby interfering with the oxidation
of the uric acid derived from its precursors in the
food: Alcohol taken without food causes no increase. The
maximum increase occurs at the same time after a meal as
it does when purin food but no alcohol is taken. Alcohol is
rapidly absorbed and passes at once to the liver, the organ
which has most to do with the metabolism of proteid cleavage
products.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>
<p>“There is no evidence that the alcohol has merely hastened
the excretion of urates normally present in the blood; the
increased excretion means that a larger quantity has been in
circulation, and although it is classed by Van Noorden among
the substances easily excreted, still most physiologists would
consider the presence in the blood of this larger quantity as
undesirable. Certainly in pathological conditions it might
be harmful.</p>

<p>“If we accept the origin of the increased quantity of uric
acid to be in the impaired oxidative powers of the liver, the
results of these experiments will have greater significance
than can be attributed to uric acid alone. For the impaired
function would affect other processes which are normally
accomplished by that organ, and the possibilities for entrance
into the general circulation of toxic substances, of
intestinal putrefaction, for instance, would be increased. The
liver performs a large number of oxidations and syntheses
designed to keep toxic substances from reaching the body
tissues, and if alcohol, in the moderate quantity which caused
the increase in uric acid excretion, impairs its power in this
respect, the prevalent ideas regarding the harmlessness of
moderate drinking need revision.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Winfield S. Hall, professor of physiology at the
Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, has
interpreted these researches of Beebe and Hunt in a
very striking way. He says that they prove that the
oxidation of alcohol in the body is a protective oxidation,
the same as the oxidation of any other poisonous
substance by the liver. His views have such an important
bearing upon the commonly accepted theory
that alcohol is in some sense a food that they are given
here, somewhat abbreviated, as a fitting finish to this
chapter. Dr. Hall says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The fact that alcohol is oxidized in the body has been
generally misunderstood. The first impression naturally was:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>‘Foods are Oxidized; Alcohol is Oxidized; therefore alcohol
is a food.’ But many difficulties appeared. A real food promotes
muscular, glandular and nerve activity, and its oxidation
maintains body temperature. But alcohol disturbs muscular,
glandular, and nervous activity, and its oxidation does
not maintain body temperature. When one eats a real food
it is assimilated largely by muscle tissue and is oxidized for
the purpose of liberating the life energy. When one ingests
alcohol it is carried by the blood to the tissues, mostly
to the liver, where it is oxidized, as any toxine would be,
for the purpose of making it harmless. Its oxidation liberates
heat energy but this energy cannot be utilized by the
body even for the maintenance of body temperature. If a
food is defined as a substance which, taken into the body, is
assimilated and used either to build or repair body structure,
or to be oxidized in the tissues to liberate the energy
used by the tissue in its normal activity, then alcohol is not
a real food.</p>

<p>“But, if alcohol is not a real food, what is the significance
of its oxidation? It has been long known that the liver produces
oxidases and that it is the site of active oxidation of
mid-products of katabolism of toxins and of other toxic
substances. Alcohol, usually formed as an excretion of the
yeast plant, is also found as a mid-product of tissue katabolism.
On a priori grounds we should expect alcohol to be
oxidized in the liver along with leucin, tyrosin, uric acid,
xanthin bodies, and various amido bodies. There have recently
appeared two most important papers based upon extended
researches upon man and lower animals. These
researches practically clear up this knotty question.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Hall then reviews the work of Dr. Reid Hunt
and Dr. S. P. Beebe, and continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The value of this work can hardly be over-estimated. In
the first place the rapid oxidation of the alcohol in the liver
is explained. <i>Alcohol itself being one of the toxic substances
which reach the liver from the alimentary canal is
at once attacked by the liver, and if the oncoming tide of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>alcohol is not too great it will practically all be oxidized.</i></p>

<p>“But the liver oxidation of other toxic substances is impaired
in the meantime so that they get past the liver to the
tissues, where they may do injury. Some of these toxins are
excreted unoxidized by the kidneys. There are three ways
of accounting for this condition: (1.) The oxidation capacity
of the liver is limited. The physiological limit of alcohol
ingestion is that amount which taxes the oxidation capacity
of the liver to its limit. When thus taxed all other toxic
substances including uric acid and the xanthin bodies pass
through the liver unoxidized to appear in the urine. (2.)
The presence of alcohol in the blood, through its toxic action
upon the liver cells, impairs the hepatic oxidation capacity
and thus permits toxic substances to pass unoxidized. (3.) A
combination of these conditions may represent the real situation.
It is hardly conceivable that the relation of alcohol to
the liver activity is not covered in the hypotheses above
formulated.</p>

<p>“We may therefore accept it as practically demonstrated by
the researches of Beebe, Hunt, and others that the oxidation
of alcohol in the liver is simply one of the defensive
activities of that organ, <i>i. e.</i>, it is a protective oxidation and
belongs strictly in the same category with the oxidation of
uric acid, xanthin bodies, leucin, tyrosins, and the amido
acids.</p>

<p>“The next question which arises is, why does the liver
select alcohol first and oxidize that substance to the exclusion
of other toxic substances up to the oxidation capacity?
The answer is probably to be found in the chemical
composition of alcohol.</p>

<p>“It oxidizes very easily, much more so than any of the other
toxic substances which gain access to the liver. Its early
oxidation may be due to this fact alone, or in part to an
actual selection on the part of the liver. Another question
of importance: Is the energy liberated in the oxidation of
alcohol in the liver available for the use of the muscles,
nervous system, or glands?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>
<p>“If this question is answered affirmatively, then alcohol is a
food. If negatively then alcohol is not a food. Let us
reason together. All body oxidations may be classified in two
groups: (1.) <i>Active oxidations</i> which take place in the active
tissues&mdash;muscles, nervous system, or glands&mdash;and take place
incident to action. It is under the perfect control of the nervous
system and is proportional to normal activity. (2.) <i>Protective
oxidations</i> which take place in the liver. This class of
oxidation processes is wholly independent of the usual tissue
activity and is proportional to the ingestion of toxic substances
and quite independent of muscle action, brain action, or gland
action, other than liver action.</p>

<p>“If the oxidation of alcohol in the liver belongs to class 1,
the following consequences should be found: (1.) The ingestion
of alcohol would lead to an increase in muscular power
and in the working capacity of the brain or glands. (2.) The
ingestion of alcohol would serve to maintain body temperature
in the healthy individual subjected to low external temperature.
(3.) The accession of muscle, brain, or gland activity
would be proportional to the amount of alcohol ingested,
but laboratory observations and general experience show that
none of these things are true; <i>i. e.</i>, the ingestion of alcohol
decreases muscle, brain, and gland work, and depresses body
temperature when external temperature is low.</p>

<p>“In the nature of the case there can be no proportional relation.
The oxidation of alcohol does not therefore belong to
class 1. If the oxidation of alcohol in the liver belongs to
class 2, the following consequences would be found: (1.) The
ingestion of alcohol would be followed by its early oxidation
in the organs in question. (2.) If the oxidation capacity of
the liver is limited this capacity may be overloaded by exceeding
the physiological limit of alcohol. (3.) If the oxidation
capacity of the liver is taxed nearly to its limit in the
oxidation of uric acid, xanthins, and other toxic substances,
the introduction of alcohol may seriously interfere with this
protective oxidation by overtaxing the capacity. (4.) If the
oxidation capacity is overtaxed, an excess of uric acid, xan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>thin
bodies, and other toxic substances will get by this portal
and reach the active tissues or the kidneys. Now all of these
things take place, so we are forced to the conclusion that the
oxidation of alcohol is a protective oxidation. In the light of
this presentation the significance of Dr. Hunt’s work becomes
very clear. The alcohol given to the animals taxed the oxidation
capacity of the liver to the limit and left the organism
defenseless against bacterial or other toxic substances.”</p></div>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Alcohol Baths</span>:&mdash;The action of alcohol upon the surface
of the body is that of a refrigerant. Alcohol baths for
debility, weakness, and states of exhaustion are opposed by
non-alcoholic physicians. The old custom of bathing a new-born
babe with whisky was simply a superstition, and a
dangerous one, because the infant should not have a refrigerant
applied to its body so soon after leaving the warm
nest where it had been sheltered so long. Warm water is
the proper liquid for a baby’s bath until it becomes hardy.
There is nothing of strength imparted by an alcohol rub;
the ‘rub’ is good, but vinegar, or water, or olive oil can be
used according to what is desired. Alcohol is not necessary
internally nor externally. Its proper use is for mechanical
purposes and to give light and heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilhelmina Lemonade</span>:&mdash;Take four or five
rough-skinned oranges (according to size) and two
pounds of sugar, in big lumps. After having cleaned
the oranges, rub the sugar with them, till the
oranges are quite white&mdash;the sugar yellow. Place
the sugar in a big earthernware pan or jar, and add
three pints of <i>cold</i> water. Then cover it up and let
it stand two days, stirring it occasionally to help the
melting. Now take two ounces of citric acid, dissolved
in a little boiling water, and add it to the
syrup, stirring the whole. Then strain the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>through a fine sieve, covered with muslin, so that it
becomes perfectly clear. In well-corked bottles it
will keep for more than a year. Mix one-third of
the lemonade with two-thirds water. [Instead of
the oranges five or six lemons may be used.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beverages for the Sick</span>:&mdash;Unfermented Grapejuice. Hot milk. Egg cream, made as follows:
Beat the white and yolk separately, add milk and
sugar, and stir well, flavor to suit taste. Egg lemonade&mdash;beat
yolk and sugar thoroughly, add lemon
and water, shake well, then add white, beaten stiff.
Barley water, made by boiling pearl barley five or
six hours, and straining the water from it; add milk
or cream if wished. These are used in the National
Temperance Hospital of Chicago.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Baths</span>:&mdash;“If all people understood the value of water to cool,
cleanse, invigorate and sustain life, and how to use it, <i>and
would use it</i>, one-half of all the afflictions from disease would be
removed; and the other half might be banished if all the people
understood how and what to eat, how to breathe, and the necessity
of daily vigorous exercise. A daily towel bath will do
more to counteract disease, and restore the body to its normal
health condition, than any other method or remedy yet discovered.
After the bath, the body should be thoroughly rubbed
with a crash or Turkish towel. Rub until a warm glow is produced.
This bath is a fine tonic if taken upon rising in the
morning.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hot Water as a Medicine</span>:&mdash;“One is never,” says a
physician, “far from a pretty good medicine chest with hot
water at hand. It is a most useful assistant to the mother of a
family of small children, who is frightened often to find herself
confronted by a sudden illness of one of her flock, without her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>usual dependence&mdash;the family doctor. If the baby has croup,
fold a strip of flannel or a soft napkin lengthwise, dip into very
hot water, and apply to the child’s throat. Repeat and continue
the application till relief is had, which will be almost at
once. For toothache, or colic, or a threatened lung congestion,
the hot-water treatment will be found promptly efficacious if
resorted to. Nature needs only a little assistance at the first
sign of trouble to rally quickly in the average healthy child, and
often hot water is all that is wanted.”</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcohol Injurious to the Insane</span>:&mdash;Dr.
Richard Maurice Bucke, whose valuable paper on
“The Evolution of the Mind” appeared in the December
number of the <i>Journal of Hygiene</i>, in a recent
report of the Asylum for the Insane in London,
Canada, makes the following statement concerning
the use of alcohol in the institution over which
he presides:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“As we have given up the use of alcohol, we have needed
and used less opium and chloral; and as we have discontinued
the use of alcohol, opium and chloral, we have needed and
used less seclusion and restraint. I have, during the year
just closed, carefully watched the effect of the alcohol given,
and the progress of cases where, in former years, it would have
been given, and I am morally certain that the alcohol used
during the past year did no good. With humiliation I am
forced to admit that in the recent past my noble profession has
been to an alarming extent, and is still too much so, guilty of
producing many drunkards in the land, directly or indirectly, by
the reckless and wholesale manner in which so many of its
members have prescribed alcoholic stimulants in their daily
practice for all the aches and pains, coughs and colds, inflammations
and consumptions, fevers and chills, at the hour of
birth and at the time of death, and all intermediate points of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>life, to induce sleep and to promote wakefulness, and for all
real or imaginary ills.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobacco and the Eyesight</span>:&mdash;“Prof. Craddock says
that tobacco has a bad effect upon the sight, and a distinct disease
of the eye is attributed to its immoderate use. Many
cases in which complete loss of sight has occurred, and which
were formerly regarded as hopeless, are now known to be curable
by making the patient abstain from tobacco. These patients
almost invariably at first have color blindness, taking red
to be brown or black, and green to be light blue or orange. In
nearly every case, the pupils are much contracted, in some
cases to such an extent that the patient is unable to move about
without assistance. One such man admitted that he had
usually smoked from twenty to thirty cigars a day. He consented
to give up smoking altogether, and his sight was fully
restored in three and a half months. It has been found that
chewing is much worse than smoking in its effects upon the
eyesight, probably for the simple reason that more of the
poison is thereby absorbed. The condition found in the eye in
the early stages is that of extreme congestion only; but this,
unless remedied at once, leads to gradually increasing disease
of the optic nerve, and then, of course, blindness is absolute
and beyond remedy. It is, therefore, evident that, to be of any
value, the treatment of disease of the eye due to excessive
smoking must be immediate, or it will probably be useless.”&mdash;<i>Journal
of Inebriety.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Isaac Fellows was for many years a prominent physician
in Los Angeles. A temperance man, he was persuaded
by an old physician whom he loved to try for a year substituting
alcohol in drop doses in water for such patients as demanded
alcoholic stimulants. He was delighted with the result.
When his patients found they could not have wine, beer or
brandy under the guise of medicine, but must take it in drop
doses in water, as they did their other medicines, they speedily
learned to do without ‘a stimulant.’”&mdash;<i>Pacific Ensign.</i></p>

<h5>ADVERTISED “CURES” FOR DRUNKENNESS.</h5>

<p>“<i>Poudre Coza</i>, an English product, is sold at $3.00 for thirty
powders. On analysis these powders were found to contain
an impure form of sodium bicarbonate, together with
a little aromatic vegetable matter. Gloria Tonic was examined
by the Massachusetts Board of Health, and found to
consist of sugar of milk and cornstarch, with a small quantity
of ground leaves resembling those of senna. White
Ribbon Remedy was found to be made of milk sugar and
ammonium chloride. Of course such things are clearly
frauds, as they can have no power to destroy a craving for
liquor. The Infallible Drink Cure was 98 per cent. sugar
and 2 per cent. common table salt. Another ‘cure’ was made
of chlorate of potash and sugar. Cases of poisoning by
chlorate of potash are on record. Another ‘cure’ contained
tartar emetic, a dangerous poison. Most of the liquid ‘cures’
for drunkenness sold prior to the passage of the National
Pure Food Law contained large quantities of cheap alcohol.
It is safe to say that practically all of the secret cures for
drunkenness are fraudulent, and some are dangerous.</p>

<p>“If a man wants to quit drinking, he can be helped by a
proper diet, and by frequent use of the Turkish bath, or
even of the ordinary hot bath at home, with a quick cold
sponge or shower bath each morning as a tonic. The hot
bath is to draw out impurities from the system. The diet
should consist of plenty of fruit, nuts, grains and vegetables.
It is better to eat no meat. It has been fully demonstrated
in Lady Henry Somerset’s work with women drunkards
that a vegetarian diet is a great help in allaying the
alcohol crave. The Salvation Army, in England, have also
found by experience that a meat-free diet is a great aid in
overcoming the drink habit.</p>

<p>“Dr. T. D. Crothers, who has for years conducted a large
sanitarium for the cure of inebriety, at Hartford, Connecticut,
says that a valuable remedy to break up the impulsive
craze for spirits is a strong infusion of quassia given in two-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>ounce
doses every hour. As desire for liquor abates the
quassia can be given less frequently, until it is no longer
needed.</p>

<p>“Dr. Alexander Lambert, of Bellevue Hospital, New York,
has been treating drunkards and other drug habitues successfully
of late. A description of his treatment may be found
in <i>Success</i> for November, 1909.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Puffs of Whisky and Other Alcoholics</span>:&mdash;
“Every medical man knows how he is pestered with advertising
circulars of so-and-so’s genuine whisky, and what-do-you-call-em’s
extra stout, to say nothing of the tempting offers of
wines and spirits on sale with special discounts to medical men.
Other enterprising firms send samples or offer to send them
with the implied understanding that a testimonial is to be given,
or that at least the wares in question will be recommended to
patients. Even our medical papers have not always been incorruptible.
We have little expectation ourselves of being favored
with an offer of full-page advertisements of extraordinary
wines and spirits. We are not prepared to recommend them
except as vermin killers. Nor are we prepared to remain silent
as to their alleged virtues. The whole system of testimonials
is a huge imposture. Granted that the sample is all that it is
described as being, who can guarantee that what is served to
the public in the face of severe competition will be up to the
sample?</p>

<p>“But there is another and a sadder view of the case. We
cannot believe that all the eulogies of all the medical trumpeters
of the wines and the spirits are wilfully false or even exaggerated.
It is a lamentable fact that a vast number of doctors
have a genuine faith in the value and virtue of these pernicious
drinks. It is not simply a question of medicinal use, though
even on that we should join issue. These things are vaunted
as valuable for the promotion of health in spite of all the accumulating
evidence to the contrary. We wish that these doctors
would carefully study this evidence. The pity of it is that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>very worst offenders are the least likely to study it. We suppose
they must die out, and be replaced by men less prejudiced
and bound by the chain of alcoholic habit. We can only regret
that they should be doing so much harm in fastening the
fetters of drink on other people, and hindering their emancipation
from the evil customs which play havoc amongst us.”&mdash;<i>Medical
Pioneer.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcohol and Children</span>:&mdash;“Parents often labor under the
delusion that alcoholic drinks are good for children and act as
tonics. Mothers will put drops of brandy into the milk with
which their children are fed, increasing the quantity with the age
of the recipient. In the illness of children the same is given to
meet disturbances of the stomach or to increase growth and
development, without taking the advice of any medical man as
to the wisdom of the practice. This is all erroneous. The
excitement of the central nervous system under alcohol, excitement
which seems to be a relief to weariness and to give
strength, is nothing more than temporary at best, and injurious,
causing in fact symptoms of alcoholic poisoning, abnormal excitement,
ending, in extreme cases, in convulsions succeeded by
exhaustion of body and mind, and inducing a kind of paralysis.
Many cases of stomach and gastric catarrh in children followed
by emaciation and debility are due to the early administration
of alcoholic drinks; and impediment of growth from the same
cause is thereby produced. The most serious derangement is
that of the nervous system, and the development in the young,
under the influence of alcohol, of what is known as nervousness,
to which is added the moral paralysis with which the
habit of alcoholic drinking smites its victims in the very spring-time
of life.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prof. Demme</span>, of Berne, Switzerland.</p>

<p>“The action of the New York Board of Health, in recommending
to tenement house parents, that on the hottest days of
summer a few drops of whisky be added to the water or food of
their infants, has received a strong protest and rebuke in a
meeting at Prohibition Park, where the opinions of eminent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>physicians, collected by the <i>Voice</i>, were read, condemning such
a course. A resolution of protest was also adopted.”&mdash;<i>Sel.</i></p>

<p>“For nineteen years we lived with a physician whose success
may be estimated from this one item: He had between 1,600
and 1,700 labor cases, and never once lost the mother, and only
twice the child, and what seems still more remarkable never
used instruments. When other physicians, as often happened,
would come to him to know how he did it, he always answered,
‘A woman will do anything if you only encourage her.’ Nor
was obstetrics his specialty&mdash;he had none.</p>

<p>“In a fifteen years’ practice in Chicago and New York, where
these diseases are so very fatal, and he was much sought after
to treat them, he did not lose a case of scarlet fever, diphtheria
or cholera infantum which he managed himself, and saved
many a one where he was called in consultation, or after some
other physician. Now when such a man after an experience
more than fifty years long and as wide as the continent, gives it
as his unqualified opinion that wines, beers, liquors of every
kind, alcohol itself, are not medicines and should never be used
as such, for <span class="smcap">scientific</span> reasons, not to mention moral, is not
his opinion entitled to a hearing? Isn’t it probable it weighs
more than the doctor’s you were just quoting? Is it too great
a risk to act upon it?”&mdash;<i>Pacific Ensign.</i></p>

<p>“A lady, Mrs. A., tenderly nurtured, refined, cultured, moving
in an influential position, belonged to a family in whom the
tendency to intemperance existed. Realizing the danger, she,
for seven years of her married life, adhered to total abstinence.
Illness came, and the doctor ordered wine; and her husband,
deaf to her arguments, insisted on her taking it. She fell into
habits of intemperance. Her husband died, and for a time she
pulled up and trained as a hospital nurse; but temptation prevailed,
and she fell from bad to worse. Loving hands received
her time after time, and at last placed her in an Inebriate
Home. For a short time she did well, but soon became unmanageable.
After another desperate period she entered a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>second home, but after leaving she yielded again, was twice in
prison, and fell into the lowest degradation and utter ruin,
surely deserving our deepest pity. Her doctor and her husband
had persisted in working her fall in spite of her own strongest
convictions.”&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">They did not Die.</span>&mdash;“Dr. Lord of Pasadena suffered
from rheumatism of the heart for more than half of a long lifetime.
No doctor ever felt his pulse (which intermitted) without
exclaiming, ‘Why, doctor, you have no business to be alive
with such a pulse,’&mdash;or something similar. For nineteen years
his wife never retired without having at least one medicine she
could put her hand on in the dark, the ammonia bottle within
reach, the electric battery ready to start like a fire-engine, and
preparations for heating water in less than no time. His acute
attacks usually came in the night&mdash;an uninterrupted night’s
sleep was something unknown to either the doctor or his wife
in all these years.</p>

<p>“They lived in sight of an open grave, and seldom a week
passed when it did not seem as if death had actually occurred.
If ever a case called for alcoholic stimulants this one did.
But none were ever administered, none were ever kept in the
house. The doctor’s standing orders were: ‘If all the doctors
in the country order you to give me liquor, and say my
life depends upon it, don’t do it. Tell them I know more about
it than they do. It won’t save my life; it will only lessen what
little chance I have.’ All who knew about this case, and hundreds
did, were driven to the conclusion that if these two people,
one in this condition and the other feeble, could live all
alone as they did, miles from a doctor, and neighbors not near,
and could get along without alcoholics of any kind, everybody
can do the same everywhere. And the doctor finally wore out
his heart trouble and died of another disease.”&mdash;<i>Pacific Ensign.</i></p></div>

<p>An English weekly journal is responsible for the
following anecdote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“A Birmingham physician has had an amusing experience.
The other day a somewhat distracted mother brought her
daughter to see him. The girl was suffering from what is
known among people as ‘general lowness.’ There was nothing
much the matter with her, but she was pale and listless and did
not care about eating or doing anything. The doctor, after
due consultation, prescribed for her a glass of claret three
times a day with her meals. The mother was somewhat deaf,
but apparently heard all he said and bore off her daughter, determined
to carry out the prescription to the very letter. In ten
days’ time they were back again, and the girl looked a different
creature. She was rosy-cheeked, smiling and the picture of
health. The doctor congratulated himself on his diagnosis of
the case. ‘I am glad to see that your daughter is so much
better,’ he said. ‘Yes,’ exclaimed the excited and grateful
mother. ‘Thanks to you, doctor! She has had just what you
ordered. She has eaten carrots three times a day since we
were here, and sometimes oftener&mdash;and once or twice uncooked&mdash;and
now look at her!’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rest Cure</span>:&mdash;“After all, the veneer of civilization is
quite thin. Scratch most people, and very near the surface you
come on the savage. This is specially true when they are sick.
They at once want charms and miracles to restore them to
health, and come to the doctor or ‘medicine man,’ as they
look upon him&mdash;with this demand: ‘I want something, doctor,
to fix me up.’ But he, unhappy man, has not wherewith to
satisfy them, unless he is a quack.</p>

<p>“He knows that in most cases all he can do is to give advice
as to how best Nature may be allowed to effect a cure; for Nature
is the great physician, and the doctor’s main duty is to stand
by and see that she gets fair play. Nature’s chief cure, in a
large number of the diseases to which flesh is heir, is rest.
The tired man needs rest. The tired brain, the tired stomach,
the tired liver and kidneys, need the same rest.</p>

<p>“So, when the patient turns up with an overworked and exhausted
organ of some sort within him&mdash;be it what it may&mdash;heart,
brain or stomach&mdash;the true physician prescribes, first and
chiefly, not drugs, but rest.</p>

<p>“Now, this is generally the advice the patient doesn’t want.
His desire is for a bottle of something, no matter how nasty it
may be, which shall ‘fix him up,’ and let him go on doing what
he has been doing previously. Common-sense is always at a
discount, and never more so than in this case. The tired brain-worker
doesn’t want to stop. Give him something to whip up
his brain and his body, something to drive the spurs into them.
‘What I want,’ he says, ‘is a really strong tonic’; though, if he
knew that before, what was the use of coming to the doctor?
Or he would like to be told to take a glass of whisky-and-water
when he is tired, which is the maddest and most disastrous
advice that could be given.</p>

<p>“The man who has been ill-treating his stomach, eating too
much or too well, also demands a tonic&mdash;something to give him
an appetite so that he may eat more. And his poor overwrought
stomach is all the time crying out for rest.</p>

<p>“So it is all along the line. The possessor of an inflamed and
swollen knee prays for a liniment to rub into it which will cure
it straight away, and is highly disgusted when told that he will
have to lie up for a week or two.</p>

<p>“Again, for the tired stomach the cure is starvation. Let
the person live on his own fat, and a little milk-and-water for a
few days, and his stomach will take courage again and return
to work with renewed zest. But it is the most difficult thing in
the world to persuade the patient or his kind relatives of the
truth of this. There are many diseases in which, for a short
time at least, the less food the sick person has the better. But
the relatives are always much wiser than the doctor. They insist
‘that the strength must be kept up,’ and would like to force
the patient to eat more than he does when well. ‘You will let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>his strength down, doctor,’ is a common complaint, and one of
the difficulties hospital authorities have to face is to prevent
kind friends from smuggling in food to the inmates, who, in
their opinion, are being brutally starved.</p>

<p>“I myself have cured people by making them rest&mdash;lie in bed
and starve. But the next time they were sick, <i>I wasn’t the
<a name="Page_421t" id="Page_421t"></a>doctor</i><a href="#Page_402tn">.”</a>&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Physician</span>” in <i>Our Federation</i>.</p>

<p>“The blessings of sunlight and fresh air should be more appreciated.
The sun is the godfather of us all. The source of
all light, heat, electricity and energy, what wonder that it was
once worshipped as the Creator. The future will recognize it
not only as the best disinfectant, an all powerful preventive of
disease, but also as a wonderful healer of disease. The more
people can be taught to live in pure air out of doors, and bask
in the rays of the sun, the less of disease there will be to
prevent.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. C. H. Shepard</span>, Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>


<h4>ALCOHOL TESTED.</h4>

<p>“Some years ago Dr. Beddoes, a physician of eminence, was
very anxious to put to the test the disputed question as to the
power of alcoholic liquors to give strength to the system. He
discovered that those who had most calls upon their physical
endurance were the smiths who were engaged in forging ship’s
anchors, for at one moment they would be exposed to a heat so
fierce that one marveled that any human organization could endure
exposure to it, and then their work would call them away
to a temperature that was chilly and cold, added to which all
the time their work lasted they were bathed in a profuse perspiration,
the demands upon their physical energy were so
great. To counteract this perpetual drain upon their system
they were in the habit of drinking unlimited quantities of beer,
which their masters provided for them as a matter of course,
and a <i>sine qua non</i>. One day, as they were resting from their
work at midday, Dr. Beddoes made his appearance amongst
some of these men who were employed in a certain foundry,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>and submitted a formal proposition to them, to this effect, that
twelve of their number, the strongest and stanchest, should be
selected for an experiment, and they should work for a week,
six of them drinking only water, and the other six taking their
beer as usual. His proposition was laughed to scorn. The
men would not hear of it. ‘Look here, mate,’ said their
spokesman, ‘do you want us to be all dead men; you don’t
know what our work is, and how it takes all a man’s strength
to weld an anchor. Why, if we did not have our beer and
plenty of it, it would be all up with us in a brace of shakes.’</p>

<p>“The doctor said: ‘I should be very sorry for any harm to
come to you. You know I am a doctor, and I will be constantly
at hand to see if any of you are going wrong, and I
promise that if I see any of you breaking down I will at once
stop my experiment.’ And then taking out of his pocket ten
crisp five-pound notes, he displayed them to the anchor smiths.
‘I will put down these notes, £50 in all; six of you shall try
water for one week honestly and fairly; if you pull through
without giving in, the £50 shall be yours; if not, I’ll take the
£50 back again. Is it a bargain?’</p>

<p>“This clenched the matter, and very soon the doctor’s offer
was accepted, and a gang of six men volunteered to begin
their work on the Monday without beer. The beer drinkers
did their best to chaff the water drinkers, and aggravated them
by taking good care to show them how very nice it was to have
recourse to unlimited beer. The water drinkers kept firm, and
the first day, to their astonishment, found that they could do
just as much work as the rest of their mates. On Tuesday the
water drinkers began to crow over the beer drinkers, for they
found that, while the latter complained and grumbled at the
heat, they were enabled to take the work in a philosophical
kind of way. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday wore away,
and the teetotal band became more and more triumphant, the
laugh was all on their side, for not only did they feel more
comfortable than their beer-loving companions, but the £50
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>came nearer and nearer, and at last, on Saturday, when the
time for finishing work came, they threw down their tools and
their hammers, and crowded up to the doctor to claim the
prize, and to give a faithful record of their experiences; and
one and all declared that they had done their hard work with
more ease and comfort to themselves than ever it had been
done before, and, instead of feeling tired and jaded, as they
often did on the Saturday afternoon, they were quite ready to
begin work again, and if the doctor had another £50 to dispose
of, they would most gladly give him a chance of protracting his
experiment for another week. The doctor expressed himself
perfectly satisfied with the trial which had already taken place,
and left the place amidst three hearty cheers, while the men
proceeded to discuss the ins and outs of the matter among
themselves.”&mdash;<i>National Advocate.</i></p>


<h4>BEER-DRINKING INJURES HEALTH.</h4>

<p>“I think there is no doubt that beer-drinking is deleterious
to health, and personally I have never seen any case of disease
where I thought it useful. I believe it is more deleterious
to health than the stronger spirits, and this opinion is
derived from the report of the actuaries’ investigations for
our insurance companies a few years ago.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. John M.
Dodson</span>, Dean of the Medical Department of the University
of Chicago.</p>

<p>“My connection with large medical institutions for many
years past has given me, I think, an excellent opportunity to
observe the effect of beer-drinking and the use of other
alcoholic liquors in many cases. I can say as a result of my
own observation that beer-drinking has a very pernicious
effect upon nearly every organ of the body. It produces
disease of the stomach and digestive tract, of the heart and
circulating system, of the kidneys and liver, and of the nervous
system. In addition to this it lessens the vigor and
vital resistance of the whole body, makes the beer drinker
very much more susceptible to infection such as pneumonia,
and other acute infections, and also lessens his ability to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>recover from illnesses of any kind. An untold amount of
misery and disease would be avoided if the use of beer and
other intoxicating liquors could be wiped off the face of the
earth.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. W. H. Riley</span>, Battle Creek Sanitarium, Battle
Creek, Mich.</p>

<p>In the report of Bellevue Hospital, New York City, for
1904, Dr. Alexander Lambert, in speaking of delirium tremens,
says: “The delirium tremens from beer does not come
on so readily as that from whisky, but is slower in clearing
up.” Page 138 of report.</p>

<p>“Apart from its toxic effect it is seldom realized how
harmful beer may be by promoting obesity, and, in susceptible
persons, favoring dilatation of the stomach.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. E. P.
Joslin</span>, Professor in Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>“It is not the concentrated alcoholic liquors alone that cause
heart and kidney trouble but pre-eminently the continued immoderate
use of beer. Nothing is more false than the belief
that the progressive dislodgement of other alcoholic
drinks by beer will diminish the destructive influences of
alcoholism. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It has been conclusively established by
thousandfold experiments that soldiers in all climates, in
heat, cold and rain, endure best the most fatiguing marches
when they are absolutely deprived of alcoholic drinks.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prof.
G. Von Bunge</span>, M. D., Basle, Switzerland.</p>

<p>“Beer, wine and spirits furnish no element capable of
entering into the composition of blood, muscular fibre, or
anything which is the seat of vital principle. If a man drinks
daily 8 or 10 quarts of the best Bavarian beer in a year he
will have taken into his system as much nourishment as is
contained in a five-pound loaf of bread.”&mdash;<i>Liebig, the great
German chemist.</i></p>

<p>“Beer-drinker’s heart is a term well-known to the physicians
of our large hospitals, and indicates a special condition
of unhealthy enlargement of the heart due to dilatation,
accompanied by some increase of tissue and of fat. Doctors
Bauer and Bollinger found that in Munich one in every sixteen
of the hospital patients died from this disorder. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>common in Germany&mdash;the land of beer-drinking&mdash;and proves
incontestably that the habit of drinking even such a mild
alcoholic beverage as lager-beer is one that is undesirable
and unwise.”&mdash;<i>From “Alcohol and the Human Body,” by Sir
Victor Horsley, M. D., London.</i></p>

<p>“Nothing is more erroneous from the physician’s standpoint,
than to think of diminishing the destructive effects of
alcoholism by substituting beer for other alcoholic drinks, or
that the victims of drink are found only in those countries
where whisky helps the people of a low grade of culture to
forget their poverty and misery.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prof. Strumpel</span>, Breslau,
Germany.</p>

<p>“The result of extolling beer as the mightiest enemy of
whisky and brandy has been that the consumption of the
distilled liquors has changed very little, while to these liquors
has been added beer, the use of which has led to a
great and still increasing beer alcoholism. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The beer drinker who is not at all a drunkard in the
popular sense, is very frequently the victim of chronic inflammation
of the kidneys. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* An enlarged and fatty
condition of the liver, marked by a dull pain in the region
of the organ, often follows from the habitual use of beer.
The death-rate from liver diseases among brewers of beer
in England is more than double that in all other occupations.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Beer-drinkers have a marked tendency to enlargement
of the stomach, and to chronic diarrhoea. Beer
causes also inflammation of the nerves. This is often announced
by ‘rheumatic’ pains in the legs. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Beer alcoholism,
as well as alcoholism in general, lowers the resistance
of the body to all diseases by injuring most of the
organs. And herein lies the chief danger in the general wide-spread
use of beer. The drinker is especially open to attacks
of infectious disease. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The brutalizing effect of
beer-alcoholism is shown most clearly by the fact that in Germany
crimes of personal violence, particularly dangerous
bodily injuries, occur most frequently in Bavaria where there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>is the highest consumption of beer.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Hugo Hoppe</span>, Nerve
Specialist, Konigsberg, Germany.</p>

<p>“The life insurance companies make a business of estimating
men’s lives, and can only make money by making correct
estimates of whatever influences life. Now they
expect a man otherwise healthy, who is addicted to beer-drinking,
will have his life shortened from 40 to 60 per cent.
For instance if he is twenty years old and does not drink
beer he may reasonably expect to live until he is 61. If he
is a beer-drinker he will probably not live to be over 35.
If he is 30 years old when he begins to drink beer he will
probably drop off somewhere between 40 and 45 instead of
living to 64 as he should. There is no sentiment, prejudice
or assertion about these figures. They are simply cold-blooded
business facts, derived from experience, and the
companies invest their money on them just the same as a
man pays so many dollars for so many feet of ground or
bushels of wheat.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. S. S. Thorn</span>, Toledo, Ohio, in U. S.
Senate Document, published in 1901.</p>

<p>“Fatty degeneration of various organs is frequently witnessed
in beer-drinkers. Diabetes mellitus is frequently due
to beer-drinking, and is made much worse by its continuance.
In Germany more than half of the cases in the inebriate
asylums enter from beer-drinking. In Bavaria, the women
are not able properly to suckle their children because of the
universal consumption of their favorite national drink. Indeed,
so grave are the evils caused by beer-drinking that
the fight against beer should now be conducted as strenuously
as that against stronger liquors.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Legrain</span>, Paris,
France.</p></div>


<h4>DRUG DRINKS.</h4>

<p>In the report of the President’s Homes Commission,
Senate Document 644, may be found a list of
soft drinks examined by the Bureau of Chemistry.
The report says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Attention is directed to the danger of soft drinks containing
caffeine, and extract of coca leaf, the active principle of
the latter being cocaine. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* We have seen how the opium
habit may be acquired by the use of the various proprietary or
secret preparations, and so the cocaine habit may be developed
by the use of these much lauded soft drinks. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* No
wonder that insanity and diseases of the nervous system are
on the increase.”</p>

<p>The following is a list of drinks examined by the Bureau of
Chemistry. Investigation showed that these contained both
caffeine and extract of coca leaf:</p>

<p>Afri Cola, Ala Cola, Cafe Coca, Carre Cola, Celery Cola,
Chan Ola, Chera Cola, Coca Beta, Coca Cola, Pilsbury’s Coke,
Cola Coke, Cream Cola, Dope, Four Kola, Hayo Kola, Heck’s
Cola, Kaye Ola, Koca Nola, Koke, Kola Ade, Kola Kola, Kola
Phos, Koloko, Kos Kola, Lime Cola, Lima Ola, Mellow Nip,
Nerv Ola, Revive Ola, Rocola, Rye Ola, Standard Cola, Toka
Tona, Tokola, Vim-O, French Wine of Coca, Wise Ola.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of some of those listed claim that their
coca extract is prepared from a decocainized coca leaf, the
refuse product discarded in the manufacture of cocaine. The
Coca Cola company claims that their coca extract is now without
cocaine, and most of the recent analyses show this to be
true, yet the Pure Food Commissioner of North Dakota says
in his report for 1907 that Coca Cola as examined by him,
“Gave a reaction for cocaine.” It is easy to see that so long
as even refuse coca leaves are used some cocaine may at times
be in the product.</p>

<p>As cocaine is the most destructive drug known to humanity
its presence in any of the so-called temperance drinks is a
frightful evil calling for speedy legislation. It is practically
impossible to cure a person of the cocaine habit. This drug
causes insomnia, dyspepsia, chronic palpitations, and complete
paralysis of will-power, with a tendency to criminal acts.
When a person becomes habituated to its use he suffers torments
when not under its influence. The real cocaine fiend
will rob or kill to get the drug. What can be thought of men,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>who knowing the deadly nature of this drug, will hide it away
in a drink sold as harmless to children and women who would
never touch beer or wines? It is placed in the drink to form
a craving for that drink and thus create a demand that will
enrich the conscienceless manufacturers.</p>

<p>The following preparations were found to contain caffeine,
but there was no evidence to the effect that coca leaf in any
form had been used in their manufacture:</p>

<p>Calcycine, Celery Cocoa, Citro Cola, Deep Rock Ginger Ale,
Fosko, Heck’s Star Pepsin, Koke, Koke Ola, Kalafra, Kumfort,
Lime Juice and Kola, Lon Kola, Meg-O, Mexicola, Pau
Pau Cola, Pedro, Pepsi Cola, Speed Ball, To-Ko, Vril.</p>

<p>The report says that the following list were not examined
but from their names, and from the evidence submitted, they
contain either caffeine or coca leaf extract, or both: Charcola,
Cherry Kola, Cola Soda, Cola Ginger, Field’s Coca, Imported
French Cola, Jacob’s Kola, Koko Ale, Kola Cream,
Kola Pepsin Celery Wine Tonic, Kola Vena, Loco Kola,
Mintola, Mate, Pikmeup, Ro-Cola, Schelhorn’s Coca, Vine
Cola, Viz.</p>

<p>Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, chief of the Bureau of Chemistry,
says that the sale of all such drinks should be prohibited.</p>

<p>Caffeine is a drug much used in headache remedies. It is
derived from the kola nut, and from tea and coffee. It is
also made artificially from uric acid occurring in the guano
or bird manure deposits of South America. This bird manure
product is said to be used in some of the drinks while
in others caffeine obtained from refuse tea sweepings is used.
The sales-manager of the Coca Cola Company says the caffeine
in their product is made from tea. It is claimed by
the manufacturers of caffeine drinks that they are as harmless
as tea or coffee. But physicians advise against the use
of tea and coffee for children and for delicate, nervous people,
and every intelligent person knows that these drinks
should not be indulged in immoderately. The secret caffeine
drinks at the soda-fountain are not warned against because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>few people know of what they are made. So it frequently
happens that children whose parents do not permit them to
drink tea and coffee are taking caffeine in a much more injurious
form at the drug stores.</p>

<p>Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry,
says: “When caffeine is separated from tea and coffee, and
used as a separate drug, it exerts a much more specific action
upon the system than when in natural combination. Its general
effect is to induce that unhappy state described as nervousness,
with deranged digestion and impaired health.” Dr.
H. H. Rusby, Dean of the College of Pharmacy, of Columbia
University, New York City, a high authority, says:
“Caffeine is a genuine poison, both acute and chronic. Taken
in the form of a beverage it tends to the formation of a
drug habit, quite as characteristic, though not so effective,
as ordinary narcotics. Permanent disorders of the cardiac
function, and of the cerebral circulation, result from its
continued use.”</p>

<p>The <i>Druggists Circular</i>, for May, 1908, contained a query
from a druggist as to a good formula for a kola nut soda
syrup. The answer was in part as follows: “There are two
kinds of druggists. One kind puts any and every kind of
stuff into stock, and passes it out to his customers, young
and old, ignorant or learned, foolish or wise, his only desire
being to get a profit. The other kind of druggist refuses to
stock some things at all. Kola drinks owe their vogue to
the caffeine which they contain. Caffeine is a poison which
is cumulative in its effects, and an excess of which has not
infrequently caused death. We believe you would better be
on record as discouraging rather than encouraging the growth
of the caffeine habit, especially among young people, who
constitute a large part of the soda-water trade.”</p>

<p>The <i>London Lancet</i> of January 25, 1908, reports the results
of experiments made in Paris with kola given to horses
to determine its action in relieving fatigue. It apparently
diminished fatigue, but the horses receiving it lost more
weight than those to whom it was not given. The experi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>menter
said this showed that kola (caffeine) like alcohol, can
give the tissues a lash with a whip, but that such energy,
artificially produced, is at the expense of the organism. So,
when people see the alluring advertisements of caffeine
drinks which “relieve fatigue,” let them beware of the relief
which carries with it injury to the body.</p>

<p>Of the most widely advertised of these caffeine drinks the
government report says: “The prevalence of the ‘Coca Cola
fiend’ is becoming a matter of great importance and concern.”
(See volume on Social Betterment of Senate Document
644, page 268.) M. M. A.</p>


<h4>SPECIAL MEDICAL DIRECTIONS FOR WOMEN.</h4>

<p>“In the treatment of diseases of women, alcohol has been
considered a very important remedy. Because it affords relief
from pain, many resort to its use during painful menstruation.
Each month either whisky, or some medicine containing
a liberal supply of alcohol, is considered a necessity.</p>

<p>“The alcohol habit is not infrequently formed in this way.
I have in my mind several cases of inebriety which were
traceable to the habit of taking something to relieve pain
at these periods. A woman whose husband held a high
official position, thus acquired a craving for alcohol and
became a confirmed drinker. He was finally compelled to
place her in an institution for treatment.</p>

<p>“Alcohol affords relief, not by lessening the internal congestion
which causes the pain, but by paralyzing or benumbing
the nervous system. In fact, alcohol, instead of
relieving, aggravates the internal congestion. It is a deceiver,
for it makes the patient believe she is benefited when
in fact the condition is made worse. The uterus has become
more congested by its use, and when the paralyzing
effect of the alcohol has worn off the pain will be found
more severe, and the demand for alcohol increased correspondingly.
The only safe and wise plan when suffering
from pain due to internal congestion is to remove the cause.
If uterine misplacement exists suitable treatment must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>taken to correct this. Almost immediate relief from pain
due to congestion of the pelvic organs may be obtained by
taking a hot full bath. A hot foot or leg bath is also a good
treatment since the warming of the extremities quickens the
circulation in the limbs and relieves congestion in the pelvic
region.</p>

<p>“There are various forms of dysmenorrhea or painful menstruation
and each form has a treatment by itself. The congestive
type which is due to taking cold is better relieved by
a hot sitz bath before the date expected, the temperature of
the water should be 101°-103° with the feet in water a degree
or two hotter. If at the time of the period the pain
still continues, an enema or vaginal douche will usually give
the necessary relief unless the patient should be exposed to
cold by allowing the hands, arms, feet or legs to become
chilled.</p>

<p>“Many women do not dress their limbs warmly enough at
any time. Just before the menstrual period the tendency is
for the pelvic organs to become congested; there is a greater
tendency to cold feet then, than at any other time. I would
therefore advise warmer clothing on the limbs at such times.
The drinking of hot pepper tea, ginger tea, etc., is a pernicious
practice, for these irritants inflame the mucous membrane
of the stomach and intestines. Hot lemonade or hot
water will afford the same relief without leaving an inflamed
surface behind to be irritated by the next meal.</p>

<p>“There are some cases of great constriction of the uterine
canal which have reflex irritability in the stomach. Those
having the stomach affected cannot take food, the least
thing is rejected. It is best for such to remain quiet in bed,
applying heat to the stomach and abdomen and to the feet
until relief is experienced. Those suffering from headache
should also remain quiet in bed. Some resort to anodynes
and form the habit of using codeine, morphine. All these
are bad and should be avoided. I have never found it necessary
to give one dose of either to relieve pain at such
times. Hot applications with the enema, vaginal douche, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>foot bath, has usually been all that was required.</p>

<p>“I recall many cases of severe pain where the extremities
were cold and clammy and the entire body was in a hysterical
contraction that were immediately relieved by a hot
vaginal douche. The muscles relaxed, the patient warmed
up and recovered nicely.</p>

<p>“For securing sleep in insomnia, a hot toddy is often used,
but a quicker and better effect can be gained by a hot, or
neutral bath. The latter given at 99° or 100° for twenty
minutes will produce sleep and refreshment, as it equalizes
the circulation by bringing the blood to the surface.</p>

<p>“It is safer under all circumstances to do without alcohol
or other dangerous drugs in treatment of these diseases.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr.
Lauretta E. Kress</span>, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;An experienced nurse says that prompt relief in
painful menstruation may often be found by sitting upon a
toilet water-jar half full or more of hot water. The steam
rises and the heat relieves.</p>


<h4>TOTAL ABSTINENCE AND LIFE INSURANCE.</h4>

<p>Nothing shows more clearly and convincingly that alcoholic
liquors have a tendency to shorten life than the figures
published by life insurance companies. A most interesting
and valuable paper upon this theme was read before
the Actuarial Society of America, in 1904, by Mr. Joel G.
Van Cise, actuary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
of the United States. In it he gives the experience of different
life insurance companies which have separate sections
for total abstainers and non-abstainers. The Mutual Life
Insurance Company of New York, one of the large companies,
showed after a few years’ experience with the two
sections a death-rate 23 per cent. higher among the drinkers
than among the abstainers. The Sceptre Life for the years
from 1884 to 1903, inclusive, gave the following: Expected
deaths of abstainers, 1,440; actual deaths, 792, being 55 per
cent. of the expected. Expected deaths of non-abstainers,
2,730; actual deaths, 1,880, or 79 per cent. of the expected.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>The Scottish Temperance Life from 1883 to 1902 gave the
following: Abstainers, expected deaths, 936; actual deaths,
420, or 45 per cent. of the expected. Non-abstainers, expected
deaths, 319; actual deaths, 225, or 71 per cent. of
the expected.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Cise goes on to show that the statistics which
have been published from time to time, giving the percentages
of mortality in the various occupations of life, invariably
show a higher death-rate among those engaged in the
liquor business than among those engaged in other lines of
work, except such as are specially hazardous. He says:
‘The higher death-rate among liquor dealers is so universally
recognized by life assurance companies that a number of
them will not issue policies, even on the lives of the richest
brewers, upon any terms, and not one of the companies,
to my knowledge, admits liquor dealers upon as advantageous
terms as those engaged in other ordinary occupations.’
He then quotes from a circular sent to the agency force of a
prominent United States company, in which attention is
called to a rule which forbids the taking of any risks on bartenders:
‘Saloonkeepers, generally, not taken, but best of
this class may be accepted on 10 or 15 year endowments
only.’ Others connected more remotely with the liquor business
might be taken with a charge of $5.00 per thousand
extra. The circular of instructions adds that the limitations
of liquor dealers are made necessary ‘by the very excessive
rate of mortality found to exist among persons so employed.’</p>

<p>Mr. Van Cise closed his address before the Actuaries’ Society
by saying: ‘I contend that the facts given in this
paper show conclusively that the effect of total abstinence is
to lower the death-rate, and increase the average duration of
human life.’</p>

<p>The Equitable Company had a section for total abstainers
for a few years which was discontinued on account of
the new insurance laws which came into effect in 1907. The
actuary writes in response to inquiry: ‘We are very careful
in our selection of risks, and only those who drink in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>moderation will be accepted. I think it safe to say that,
other things being equal, all American life insurance companies
would consider a total abstainer a more desirable
risk than a moderate drinker.’</p>

<p>The United Kingdom Temperance and General Provident
Institution, of London, is a large and successful company
which was organized in 1840, expressly for total abstainers,
because at that time larger premiums were asked from abstainers
than from drinkers, the common opinion then being
that alcoholic liquors were necessary to health. In 1846, this
company added a general section, in which carefully selected
moderate drinkers were accepted, but each section was kept
entirely separate from the other. This separation has continued
to the present time, both classes paying the same
premiums, but sharing in profits according to the earnings
of the section to which the members belong. From 1866 to
1900, for every 100 deaths in the temperance section there
were 137 deaths in the moderate drinking section, based on
a corresponding number of lives at risk. The dividends for
a recent five years average $20 to the temperance members,
and $17 to the drinking members.</p>

<p>The actuary of this English company, Mr. Roderick Mackenzie
Moore, read a paper before the Institute of Actuaries,
in 1903, in which he reviewed the work of this company during
its history of sixty years’ experience with abstainers
and over fifty with non-abstainers. He showed that there
has been no marked difference in the number of policies in
force in the two sections, and the average amount of the
policies in each section has been about the same, so that the
comparison is as fair as could possibly be made. He gives
these figures: ‘Non-abstainers, male, expected deaths, 8,911;
actual deaths, 8,947; per cent. of actual to expected, 100.4.
Abstainers, male, expected deaths, 6,899; actual deaths, 5,124;
per cent. of actual to expected, 74.3.’ This shows a difference
of 26.1 per cent. between the actual and expected deaths
of abstainers and moderate drinkers, and the full figures
show the death rate among the drinkers to be 35 per cent.
higher than among the abstainers.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>
<p>The American Temperance Life Insurance Association
was organized in 1887. It gives a lower premium rate to
members of the abstainers’ section than to those in the general
section. The circulars sent out by this company state
that the average life of moderate drinkers is thirty-five and
a half years; tipplers, fifty-one years; total abstainers, sixty-four
and one-fifth years.</p>

<p>Very interesting is the result of an inquiry made of various
insurance companies not long ago as to whether they
consider the habitual user of intoxicating beverages as good
an insurance risk as the total abstainer; ‘if not, why not?’
All but two out of forty-one companies answered, ‘No.’
The two answered, ‘Depends on quantity used.’ In answer
to the ‘Why not?’ the Etna said, ‘Drink diseases the system
and shortens life’; Hartford Life, ‘Moderate use lays foundation
for disease’; Knights of the Maccabees, ‘Drink tends
to destroy life’; Knights Templar and Masons’ Life Indemnity,
‘Drink lessens ability to overcome disease’; Sun Life,
‘Drink injures constitution. Habit apt to grow’; Massachusetts
Mutual Life, ‘Drink causes organic changes. Reduces
expectation of life nearly two-thirds.’ The rest of the
answers are much the same as these.&mdash;<i>M. M. A.</i></p></div>
